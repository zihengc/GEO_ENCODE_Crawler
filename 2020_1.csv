Targets including CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD-L1 and PD-1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The Nanostring PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel was used for gene expression profiling. Data were externally validated in the TCGA head and neck (HNSCC), melanoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cohorts. A 24-immune gene signature was identified that discriminated more aggressive OTSCC cases, and although not prognostic in HNSCC was associated with survival in other TCGA cohorts (improved survival for melanoma, p<0.001 and worse survival for LSCC, p=0.038). OTSCC exhibited concordant gene and IHC features characterized by a TH-2 biased, pro-inflammatory profile with upregulated B cell and neutrophil gene activity and increased CD4, FOXP3 and PD-L1 expression (p<0.001 for all by IHC). Compared to less advanced disease, nodal involvement and recurrent OTSCC did not induce a different immune response although recurrent disease was characterized by significantly higher PD-L1 expression (p=0.004 by SP263, p=0.013 by 22C3, p=0.004 for gene expression). Identification of a gene signature associated with different prognostic effects in other cancers highlights common pathways of immune dysregulation that are impacted by the tumor origin.

We previously reported that phospho-Ser134-GR (pS134-GR) species are elevated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and cooperate with hypoxia-inducible factors, providing a novel avenue for activation of GR in response to local or cellular stress. We probed GR regulation by factors (cytokines, growth factors) that are rich within the tumor microenvironment (TME). TNBC cells harboring endogenous wild-type (wt) or S134A-GR species were created by CRISPR/Cas knock-in and subjected to transwell migration, invasion, soft-agar colony formation, and tumorsphere assays. RNA-Seq was employed to identify pS134-GR target genes that are regulated both basally (intrinsic) or by TGFβ in the absence of exogenously added GR ligands. Regulation of selected basal and TGFβ-induced pS134-GR target genes was validated by qRT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Bioinformatics tools were used to probe public data sets for expression of pS134-GR 24-gene signatures. In the absence of GR ligands, GR is transcriptionally activated via p38-dependent phosphorylation of Ser134 as a mechanism of homeostatic stress-sensing and regulated upon exposure of TNBC cells to TME-derived agents. The ligand-independent pS134-GR transcriptome encompasses TGFβ1 and MAPK signaling gene sets associated with TNBC cell survival and migration/invasion. Accordingly, pS134-GR was essential for TNBC cell anchorage-independent growth in soft-agar, migration, invasion, and tumorsphere formation, an in vitro readout of cancer stemness properties. Both pS134-GR and expression of the MAPK-scaffolding molecule 14-3-3ζ were essential for a functionally intact p38 MAPK signaling pathway downstream of MAP3K5/ASK1, indicative of a feed-forward signaling loop wherein self-perpetuated GR phosphorylation enables cancer cell autonomy. A 24-gene pS134-GR-dependent signature induced by TGFβ1 predicts shortened overall survival in breast cancer patients. Phospho-S134-GR is a critical downstream effector of p38 MAPK signaling and TNBC migration/invasion, survival, and stemness properties. Our studies define a ligand-independent role for GR as a homeostatic “sensor” of intrinsic stimuli as well as extrinsic factors rich within the TME (TGFβ1) that enables potent activation of the p38 MAPK stress-sensing pathway and nominate pS134-GR as a therapeutic target in aggressive TNBC.",Homo sapiens,Glucocorticoid Receptors are Required Effectors of TGFb1-Induced p38 MAPK Signaling to Advanced Cancer Phenotypes in Triple Negative Breast Cancer

Data suggests a role for costimulatory pathways, particularly CD28, in exhausted T-cell responsiveness to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional approaches to dissect the relation between CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, CD28 costimulation, and tumor specificity in head and neck, cervical, and ovarian cancers. We found that memory tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, but not bystander cells, sequentially express immune checkpoints once they infiltrate tumors leading, in situ, to a functionally exhausted population. Exhausted T cells were nonetheless endowed with effector and tumor residency potential but exhibited loss of the costimulatory receptor CD28 in comparison to their circulating memory counterparts. Accordingly, PD-1 inhibition improved proliferation of circulating tumor-specific CD8 T cells and reversed functional exhaustion of specific T cells at tumor sites. In agreement with their tumor specificity, high infiltration of tumors by exhausted cells was predictive of response to therapy and survival in ICB-treated head and neck cancer patients. Our results showed that PD-1 blockade–mediated proliferation/reinvigoration of circulating memory T cells and local reversion of exhaustion occur concurrently to control tumors.",Homo sapiens,Dual Relief of T-Lymphocyte Proliferation and Effector Function Underlies Response to PD-1 Blockade in Epithelial Malignancies

High risk genus α human papillomaviruses (α-HPVs) express two versatile oncogenes (α-HPV E6 and E7) that use both approaches simultaneously. To identify new interactions with DNA repair pathways, we conducted a computational analysis of gene expression in cervical cancer (CaCx) transcriptomic datasets and identified a frequent upregulation of translesion synthesis (TLS) genes. TLS polymerase genes, particularly the gene for POLη (POLH), did not follow this pattern. Characterization of α-HPV oncogene expressing cell lines and premalignant cervical tissue confirm these data. They also show that the increased TLS protein abundance come in response to nucleoside depletion. Primary and transformed cell lines to demonstrate that α-HPV E6 blocks POLη induction by degrading p53. Lack of POLη dooms the pathway, preventing it from facilitating tolerance of replication stress. Failed TLS results in replication fork stalling and collapse into deleterious double strand breaks in the DNA (DSBs). Consequently, cellular genome fidelity decreases in a manner consistent with the mutations that accumulate during CaCx progression. Alterations in TLS are determinants for the efficacy of the chemotherapeutics most often used to treat CaCx (cisplatin and carboplatin). Exogenous expression of POLη protected CaCx cells from cisplatin-associated toxicity/damage, effectively stabilizing their genome. TLS polymerase expression is also a prognostic factor in CaCx. Analysis of the cancer genome atlas database (TCGA) shows increased expression of these genes correlated with over a decade shorter median survival.",Homo sapiens,HPV E6 Impairs Translesion Synthesis by Blocking POLη Induction

Recently, reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells following PD-1 blockade was shown to be CD28-dependent in mouse models. Herein, we examined the role of CD28 in anti-PD-1-induced human T-cell reinvigoration using tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TILs) obtained from non-small cell lung cancer patients. Single cell analysis demonstrated a distinct expression pattern of CD28 between mouse and human CD8+ TILs. Furthermore, we found that human CD28+CD8+, but not CD28–CD8+ TILs, responded to PD-1 blockade irrespective of B7/CD28 blockade, indicating that CD28 co-stimulation in human CD8+ TILs is dispensable for PD-1 blockade-induced reinvigoration, and loss of CD28 expression rather serve as a marker of anti-PD-1-unresponsive CD8+ TILs. Transcriptionally and phenotypically, PD-1 blockade-unresponsive human CD28–PD-1+CD8+ TILs exhibited characteristics of terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells with low TCF1 expression. Notably, CD28–PD-1+CD8+ TILs had preserved machinery to respond to IL-15, and IL-15 treatment enhanced proliferation of CD28–PD-1+CD8+ TILs as well as CD28+PD-1+CD8+ TILs. Taken together, we demonstrate loss of CD28 expression as a marker of PD-1 blockade-unresponsive human CD8+ TILs with TCF1– signature and provide mechanistic insights into combining IL-15 with anti-PD-1.",Homo sapiens,PD-1 blockade-unresponsive human tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells are marked by loss of CD28 expression and rescued by IL-15

However, no functional study on eutherian Leg1s has been published at present. Thus, we first report here a functional prediction research in a cellular model. As previously reported, eutherian Leg1s could be classified into three paralogous groups. Pig has all three Leg1 genes, while human and mouse only have retained Leg1a. Hence, pig is an ideal model to study the gene function. RNA-seq was then performed by overexpression of pig Leg1s and platypus MLP in the HepG2 cells. Enrichment analysis showed that pLeg1a and pLeg1b might be of little function in the liver cell; however, pLeg1c was probably involved in the ER stress response and protein folding. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that platypus MLP has anti-bacterial activity confirming the functional study in the platypus.

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier to immunotherapy. Within solid tumors, why monocytes preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) but not immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Using multiple murine sarcoma models, we found that the TME induced retinoic acid (RA) production by tumor cells, which polarized intratumoral monocyte differentiation towards TAMs and away from DCs via suppression of DC-promoting transcription factor Irf4. Genetic inhibition of RA production by tumor cells or pharmacologic inhibition of RA signaling within TME increased stimulatory monocyte-derived cells, enhanced T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity and demonstrated striking synergy with immune checkpoint blockade. Further, RA responsive gene signature in human monocytes correlated with an immunosuppressive TME in multiple human tumors.

MicroRNAs are predicted to regulate the expression of more than 60% of mammalian genes and play fundamental roles in most biological processes. Deregulation of miRNA expression is a hallmark of most cancers and further investigation of mechanisms controlling miRNA biogenesis is needed. The dsRNA-binding protein, NF90 has been shown to act as a competitor of Microprocessor for a limited number of pri-miRNAs. Here, we show that NF90 has a more widespread effect on pri-miRNA biogenesis than previously thought. Genome-wide approaches revealed that NF90 is associated with the stem region of 38 pri-miRNAs, in a manner that is largely exclusive of Microprocessor. Following loss of NF90, 25 NF90-bound pri-miRNAs showed increased abundance of mature miRNA products. NF90-targeted pri-miRNAs are highly stable, having a lower free energy and fewer mismatches compared to all pri-miRNAs. Mutations leading to less stable structures reduced NF90 binding while increasing pri-miRNA stability led to ac quisition of NF90 association, as determined by RNA EMSA. NF90-bound and modulated pri-miRNAs are embedded in introns of host genes and expression of several is concomitantly modulated, including an oncogene implicated in metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, TIAM2.

Results: ChIP-seq analysis revealed a large number of genomic regions bound by MAX (around 13000 peaks), while BMAL1 binding was limited to about 800 regions. BMAl1 and MAX bound regions comprised both promoters and distal sites. Coherently with the circadian role of BMAL1 and its preference for E-box-containing sites, ontological annotation of BMAL1 bound regions showed a significant enrichment for circadian regulated genes and E-box motifs. The 85% of the BMAL bound sites overlapped with MAX bound regions. MAX enrichment was higher on the genomic regions co-bound by BMAL1 compared with MAX binding loci sites in which BMAL1 was not present, thus indicating that MAX/BMAL1 sites are bound by MAX with high affinity. Strikingly, MAX enrichment was observed on all E-box-containing promoters of the clock core genes.",Homo sapiens,"MYC-associated factor X, MAX, binds BMAL1 targeted genomic regions with high affinity [ChIP-Seq]"

KSHV expresses the multifunctional protein ORF57, which increases viral transcripts stability by protecting them preferentially from ARS2-dependent decay. However, a subset of viral transcripts succumb to PPD even in the presence of ORF57, but the role of PPD during KSHV infection is not completely understood. We inactivated both decay pathways using siRNA and monitored their contribution to viral gene expression in the presence of ORF57 by RNA-Seq at 24 hours post induction (hpi). Inactivation of PPD, but not ARS2-mediated decay, results in aberrant accumulation of late transcripts, which are typically expressed at 48 hpi. PPD exerts its functions post-transcriptionally as the upregulation of late genes is independent of viral transactivation factors needed for their expression. Remarkably, at their proper time of expression, PPD inactivation has no effect on late transcripts. We further show that PPD evasion by late transcripts requires the host factor NRDE2. In conclusion, our studies show that KSHV uses PPD to fine-tune the temporal expression of its genes by preventing their premature accumulation.",Homo sapiens,Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus fine-tunes the temporal expression of its genes manipulating a specific host RNA quality control pathway

Among these, we further characterized the locus in MX2 gene on chromosome band Chr21q22.3 and validated a functional variant, rs398206. The functional variant mediates allelic transcriptional activity via binding of the transcription factor, YY1. This allelic transcriptional regulation largely accounts for a significant cis-eQTL of the HIV-1 restriction gene, MX2, in primary melanocytes, where the melanoma risk-associated A allele is correlated with higher MX2 levels.

Moreover, ex vivo analysis of tumor microenvironment and NK cell phenotype was performed. Results: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are indispensable for PD-1 induction on human NK cells, in cooperation with a combination of cytokines that are abundant at the tumor site.

Within the respiratory epithelium, more than one cell type expresses CFTR and the molecular mechanism controlling its transcription are likely divergent between them. Here we determine how two extragenic CREs that are prominent in secretory epithelial cells in the lung, regulate expression of the gene. We showed earlier that these CREs, located at -44kb and -35 kb upstream of the promoter, have strong cell-type-selective enhancer function. They are also responsive to inflammatory mediators and to oxidative stress, consistent with a key role in CF lung disease. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to remove these CREs from the endogenous locus in human bronchial epithelial cells. Loss of either site extinguished CFTR expression and abolished long-range interactions between these sites and the gene promoter. The deletions also greatly reduced promoter interactions with the 5’ TAD boundary. We show substantial recruitment of RNAPII to the -35kb element and identify CEBPβ as a key activating transcription factor for airway expression of CFTR, likely through occupancy at both the CRE and the gene promoter.",Homo sapiens,Looping of upstream cis-regulatory elements is required for CFTR expression in human airway epithelial cells [ChIP-seq]

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in ER+ breast cancer. However, their effects are still limited by drug resistance. In this study, we aim to explore the role of long noncoding RNA TROJAN in ER+ breast cancer. Methods: The expression level of TROJAN in breast cancer tissue and cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro and in vivo assays as well as patient derived organoids were preformed to explore the phenotype of TROJAN in ER+ breast cancer. The TROJAN-NKRF-CDK2 axis were screened and validated by RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, microarray, dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Results: Herein, we showed that TROJAN was highly expressed in ER+ breast cancer. TROJAN promoted cell proliferation and resistance to a CDK4/6 inhibitor and was associated with poor survival in ER+ breast cancer. TROJAN can bind to NKRF and inhibit its interaction with RELA, upregulating the expression of CDK2. The inhibition of TROJAN abolished the activity of CDK2, reversing the resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor. A TROJAN antisense oligonucleotide sensitized breast cancer cells and organoids to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib both in vitro and in vivo.

Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is the driving force for metastatic colonization in which E-cadherin reexpression is a critical procedure. It has been reported that the loss of paired-related homeobox transcription factor 1 (PRRX1) is required for cancer cell metastasis in vivo. However, the role of PRRX1 in MET and how its downregulation triggers E-cadherin reexpression are unknown. In this study, we performed a systematic, mechanistic study regarding the role of PRRX1 in MET of HCC. We observed PRRX1 downregulation in HCC tissues which correlated with early metastasis and short overall survival time. Overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT, but did not promote metastasis formation, while knockdown of PRRX1 promoted metastasis and colonization of circulating HCC cells as shown in in situ liver tumor model and colonization model. PRRX1 protein levels reversely correlated with E-cadherin levels in HCC cell lines. PRRX1 knockdown promoted E-cadherin reexpression and cell proliferation, inhibited cell invasion and migration. The microarray results showed that PRRX1 deficiency regulated extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, focal adhesion, TGF-β signaling and cancer pathways. PRRX1 knockdown upregulated PITX2 (paired like homeodomain 2) and inhibited CTNNB1 (catenin beta 1) and SLUG. Silencing of PITX2 reversed CTNNB1 and SLUG inhibition and E-cadherin reexpression. PITX2 upregulation increased miR-200a and miR-200b/429, which further inhibited the transcription of CTNNB1 and SLUG, respectively, thus abrogating the inhibitory effect on E-cadherin. In conclusion, our data showed that the downregulation of PRRX1 induced E-cadherin reexpression through PITX2/miR-200a/CTNNB1 and PITX2/miR-200b/429/SLUG pathway, making PRRX1 a novel prognostic factor for HCC.",Homo sapiens,PRRX1 deficiency induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition through PITX2/miR-200-dependent SLUG/CTNNB1 regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma

Through investigation of recently published studies, we found that several previously reported CTC “biomarkers” were apparently contaminated by blood-derived transcripts such as HBB, HBA1/2, ITGA2B, and LCP1. Through re-analysis of several published CTC and cell line datasets, we revealed that CTC “biomarkers” were not only highly expressed in blood, but showed a high correlation between CTC and blood. We sequenced transcriptome of seven blood components from a healthy donor, finding that the platelet exhibited the highest probability to confound CTC data in terms of expression profiling and correlation analysis. Using CTC spike-in and recovery assay and we showed that the platelet induced artifacts could be reproduced in vitro. Surprisingly, the reproduced artifacts were also highly expressed in the platelet data but not in the other six blood components. We performed SNP calling on recovered CTC simulators, finding cross-contamination of exogenous transcripts. Furthermore, we applied a multiple linear regression model to estimate the platelet confounding index, showing that previously published CTC datasets were confounded with 13%~26% of platelet fractions and 7.9%~17% platelet cloaking judged by fluorescence flow cytometry. We devised a red blood cell lysis based protocol that better removed platelet compared to several platelet inhibitory reagents and kept transcriptomic profile undisturbed in CTC scRNA-seq.

We analyzed biological functions of PRMT6 in GC cell lines using a lentivirus overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of PRMT6 systems. Results: Increased H3R2me2as was found in 68 GC (51.1%) cases and independently correlated with poor prognosis.

Currently, there is no effective therapy to treat PDAC, and thus detailed molecular and functional evaluation of PDAC is needed to identify and develop better therapeutic strategies. Here we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) is overexpressed in PDAC and that inhibition of KLF7 blocks PDAC tumor growth and metastasis in cell culture and in mice. KLF7 expression in PDAC can be upregulated due to activation of a MAP kinase pathway or inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53, two alterations that occur in a large majority of PDACs. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of KLF7 inhibits the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are necessary for KLF7-mediated PDAC tumor growth and metastasis. KLF7 knockdown also results in the downregulation of Discs Large MAGUK Scaffold Protein 3 (DLG3), resulting in Golgi complex fragmentation, and reduced protein glycosylation leading to reduced secretion of cancer-promoting growth factors such as chemokines. Genetic or pharmacological activation of Golgi complex fragmentation blocks PDAC growth and metastasis similar to KLF7 inhibition.

Although the dominant strand may alter depending on cellular contexts, the molecular mechanism and physiological significance of such alternative strand selection (or “arm switching”) remain elusive. Here we find miR-324 as one of the strongly regulated miRNAs by arm switching, and identify terminal uridylyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 as the key regulators. Uridylation of pre-miR-324 by TUT4/7 re-positions DICER on the pre-miRNA and shifts the cleavage site. This alternative processing produces a duplex with a different terminus, from which the 3′ strand (3p) is selected instead of the 5′ strand (5p). In glioblastoma, the TUT4/7 and 3p levels are upregulated while the 5p level is reduced. Manipulation of the strand ratio is sufficient to impair glioblastoma cell proliferation.

This question is addressed in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a myeloid neoplasm in which clinical diversity contrasts with a limited genetic heterogeneity. By reprogramming CMML-patient and healthy donor CD34-positive cells, we generated induced pluripotent cell clones (iPSC). In one of the patients, we captured a part of the genetic heterogeneity of the leukemic clone and analyzed five iPSCs with two distinct genetic backgrounds, i.e. with and without KRASG12D mutation. Hematopoietic differentiation of these clones recapitulated the main features of the patient disease, including overproduction of granulomonocytes and dysmegakaryopoiesis. These analyses also disclosed significant discrepancies in the behavior as well as the DNA methylation pattern of hematopoietic cells derived from iPSCs with similar genetic background. Introduction of SRSF2P95H mutation in a KRAS-mutated iPSC partially suppressed the functional and epigenetic gap with the other KRAS-mutated clone. Despite the similar functional behavior of these two clones, only the SRSF2P95H clone responded to low doses of the hypomethylating agent decitabine by restoration of a more balanced production of hematopoietic cells. These analyses unravel additional levels of intraclonal heterogeneity beyond the coding mutations, which may also modulate individual cell response to treatment.",Homo sapiens,Functional heterogeneity exceeds genetic heterogeneity in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

While MDS patients have an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), most MDS patients actually succumb to progressive bone marrow failure. Amongst patients classified as low-risk MDS, different clinical evolutions have been observed, with some patients remaining relatively stable for long periods of time (herein, stable MDS), while others show more progressive disease, with worsening cytopenias, and often increased transfusion requirements (herein, progressive MDS). Current risk stratification strategies fail to distinguish these two groups at diagnosis. We report here that these distinct behaviors are encoded at the epigenetic level and that examining DNA methylation profiles of low-risk MDS patients captures underlying differences between the two different groups. In this study, we identified 356 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between stable and progressive low-risk MDS at the time of diagnosis. The number of DMRs was almost doubled at the time of progression (681 follow-up DMRs), and this was accompanied by an increase in the local variability at specific methylation regions, and an increase in heterogeneity over time.

Methods: A supervised analysis of microarray data from the Alliance/ACOSOG Z1031 trial was conducted to identify upregulated genes in Luminal B breast cancers that exhibited persistent tumor proliferation despite aromatase inhibitor therapy (33 cases Ki67 >10%) versus Luminal B breast cancers that were more sensitive (33 cases Ki67 <10%).  Results: This study identified thirty genes (Pearson’s r>0.4 with Ki67 as a continuous variable). These genes were enriched for immune tolerance processes (p<0.005) and three targetable immune checkpoint components were upregulated in resistant cases: IDO1, LAG3, and PD1. High IDO1 mRNA associated with poor prognosis in ER+ disease across two independent cohorts (METABRIC and TCGA). Furthermore, analysis indicated IDO1 was tightly associated with IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling.  As a composite immune tolerance signature, expression of these pathway components associated with higher baseline Ki67 and lower ER, PgR levels and poor disease specific survival.  In tissue microarray analysis, IDO1 was observed in stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages, with a higher incidence in Luminal B cases.  Further mRNA and tissue microarray analyses associated IDO1 expression with the presence of macrophages (M1 by CIBERSORT) and regulatory T cells.

Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 50-75 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome Human Feb.2009 (GRCh37/hg19) (hg19). By RNA-seq analysis, knockdown of TFAP2C in HCC1954 with siRNA (compared to NT siRNA) identified 364 genes with significantly altered expression. To further create specificity for AP-2gamma-regulated genes, RNA-seq analysis was performed comparing expression in shHCC1954 with shTFAP2C cells vs. shNT; this analysis identified 8,986 genes with significantly altered expression. The two data sets were subsequently compared to identify a set of genes that were consistently altered with knockdown of TFAP2C by siRNA and shRNA. This comparison confirmed the identification of 152 AP-2gamma target genes in HCC1954 cells. Because HCC1954 demonstrated opposite growth regulation and invasiveness with knockdown of TFAP2C compared to SKBR3, we hypothesized that the AP-2gamma target genes responsible for growth and invasion would be differentially regulated with knockdown of TFAP2C in HCC1954 versus SKBR3. Hence, RNA-seq analysis was performed in SKBR3 after knockdown of TFAP2C with siRNA; in this analysis, a total of 3814 genes were significantly altered. The pattern of expression for the 152 AP-2gamma target genes identified in HCC1954 was subsequently compared to expression changes in SKBR3. Of note, only 79 of the 152 TFAP2C target genes in HCC1954 were found to change expression significantly in the RNA-seq data set from SKBR-3. Conclusions: Knockdown of TFAP2C with co-knockdown of CDH5 in SKBR-3 confirmed no significant effect on invasion, though there was a slight reduction in invasiveness with knockdown of CDH5 that failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.12). These findings support the conclusion that regulation of CDH5 and CDKN1A contribute to alterations of proliferation and invasiveness induced by knockdown of TFAP2C.",Homo sapiens,A TFAP2C Gene Signature is Predictive of Outcome in HER2 Breast Cancer (RNA-Seq)

Pathway analysis revealed a strong enrichment of genes involved in T cell proliferation, cytokine and chemokine signalling, F-actin polymerization, T cell differentiation and co-stimulation. Notably, avadomide induced the expression of IFN type I inducible chemokines Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Cxcl11 that have been associated with activation of Th1 immunity and favourable response to immunotherapy in solid cancer. In addition, genes associated with IFN-induced counter-regulatory pathways including Cd274 (PD-L1), Lag3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) and Ido1 (indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase) were also upregulated by avadomide. Our analysis revealed that avadomide and the combination treatments induced IFN signaling in both good and poor prognostic disease subtypes, suggesting that therapies targeting patient T cells could be effective for all CLL patients. Thus, these results demonstrate the ability of avadomide to normalize dysfunctional IFN and chemokine responses in patient T cells that are linked to anti-tumor immunity.",Homo sapiens,Transcriptome analysis of purified T cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with avadomide alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies

However, its target mRNAs and its role in MM pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and gene expression analysis we found that inactivation of FAM46C in MM downregulates immunoglobulins (Igs) and several mRNAs encoding ER-resident proteins, including some involved in unfolded protein responses (UPRs), such as PDIA6, ERP44 and EDEM2, and others that affect glycosylation, such as SSR4, AGA and DDOST. We show that FAM46C expression is induced during PC differentiation and that Ig mRNAs encoding heavy and light chains are direct substrates of the ncPAP, as revealed by poly(A) tail-length determination assays. The absence of the ncPAP results in Ig mRNA poly(A) tail-shortening, leading to a reduction in mRNA and protein abundance. On the other hand, loss of FAM46C upregulates metastasis-associated lncRNA MALAT1 and results in a sharp increase in the migration ability of MM cells. This phenotype depends mainly on the activation of PI3K/Rac1 signaling in FAM46C knockout cells since treatment with specific inhibitors substantially reduces cell mobility. This finding may have significant therapeutic implications. In conclusion, our results identify Ig mRNAs as targets of FAM46C, reveal an important function of this protein during PC maturation to increase antibody production, and show that its inactivation in MM increases cell migration and invasion, which might explain the poor prognosis of MM patients with FAM46C alterations and its role as a tumor suppressor.",Homo sapiens,FAM46C controls antibody production by the polyadenylation of Ig mRNAs and inhibits cell migration in multiple myeloma

Here we reveal a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the biosynthetic capacities of CRC cells. We discover that the majority of ribosomal DNA transcription and protein synthesis in CRCs occur in a limited subset of tumor cells that localize in defined niches. The rest of the tumor cells undergo an irreversible loss of their biosynthetic capacities as a consequence of differentiation. Cancer cells within the biosynthetic domains are characterized by elevated levels of the RNA Polymerase 1 subunit A - POLR1A. Genetic ablation of POLR1A-high cell population imposes an irreversible growth arrest to CRCs. We show that elevated biosynthesis defines stemness in both LGR5+ and LGR5- tumor cells.

Despite evidence that some EREs can be expressed at the RNA and protein levels in specific contexts, a systems-level evaluation of their expression in human tissues is lacking. We report that all human tissues express EREs but the breadth and magnitude of ERE expression are very heterogeneous from one tissue to another. ERE expression was particularly high in two MHC-I-deficient tissues (ESCs and testis) and one MHC-I-expressing tissue, mTECs. In mutant mice, we report that the exceptional expression of EREs in mTECs was AIRE-independent. MS analyses identified 103 non-redundant ERE-derived MAPs (ereMAPs) in B-LCLs. These ereMAPs preferentially derived from sense translation of intronic EREs. Notably, detailed analyses of their amino acid composition revealed that ERE-derived MAPs presented homology to viral MAPs. This study shows that ERE expression in somatic tissues is more pervasive and heterogeneous than anticipated. The high and diversified expression of EREs in mTECs and their ability to generate MAPs suggest that EREs may play an important role in the establishment of self-tolerance. The viral-like properties of ERE-derived MAPs suggest that those not expressed in mTECs can be highly immunogenic. ",Homo sapiens,Widespread and tissue-specific expression of endogenous retroelements in human somatic tissues

Genomic studies revealed that del17p was associated with reduced copy number and mRNA expression of RNA polymerase II subunit alpha (POLR2A), which is located near TP53. We therefore studied HDP-101, an anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with the POLR2A poison α-amanitin, which showed potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against cell lines and primary samples. POLR2A knockdown (KD) in both TP53 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) cells, with the latter being a model of del17p, enhanced sensitivity to HDP-101 compared to POLR2A WT cells. Gene expression profiling and proteomic studies showed evidence for activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response, as well as a reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1. Bortezomib enhanced the activity of HDP-101, as did a gamma-secretase inhibitor, and this ADC overcame resistance both due to microenvironmental factors and in acquired drug resistance models. Finally, HDP-101 was well tolerated in vivo, reduced disease burden with single, 2-4 mg/kg doses, and no evidence of relapse was seen out to 100 days, even in xenografts that modeled del17p through dual TP53 KO/POLR2A KD, which grew more aggressively without treatment. Together, the data validate the efficacy of a new BCMA ADC that is ready for clinical translation, and suggest that it could be equipotent, or perhaps even more effective against myeloma with del17p.

Predictive value of combination markers statistically selected were evaluated by cross validation and linear discriminant analysis on discovery and validation cohorts, respectively.

Here, using ultra-deep RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic hAGO2 in human breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells, we have identified over one thousand novel AGO2-associated small RNAs. These include a wide variety of isomiRs, in excess of 100 mirtron loci and H/ACA snoRNA and HY3 repeat-derived small RNAs. Unexpectedly, we also discovered 298 AGO2-loaded exon-derived miRNAs (emiRs). These conserved small RNAs are encoded within protein-coding exons and 3’UTRs, have a 5’ end adenosine bias (in contrast to the 5’ U observed in canonical miRNAs), are DICER-1 dependent, processed from mature mRNAs post-splicing and derived from a wide variety of genes involved in differentiation and development including SOX4, JUN, c-MYC and AGO2 itself. We find evidence of emiR expression in human brain and other peripheral tissues, and demonstrate that human emiRs are conserved and detected in murine Ago2 small RNA libraries. Five human emiR loci coincide with known Mendelian disease-causing mutations, and the expression of emiRs is altered in human breast cancer, which may indicate that these species can play a role in disease etiology and progression.

Several genome wide studies have been performed on ESCC cohorts from Asian countries, North America, Malawi and other parts of the world but none has been conducted on ESCC tumors from South Africa to date, where the molecular pathology and etiology of this disease remains unclear. We report here tumor associated copy number changes observed in 51 ESCC patients’ samples from the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. We extracted tumor DNA from 51 archived ESCC specimens and interrogated tumor associated DNA copy number changes using Affymetrix® 500K SNP array technology. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm was applied to identify significant focal regions of gains and losses. Gains of the top recurrent cancer genes were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry. Twenty-three significant focal gains were identified across samples. Gains involving the CCND1, MYC, EGFR and JAG1 loci recapitulated those described in studies on Asian and Malawian cohorts. The two most significant gains involved the chromosomal sub-bands 3q28, encompassing the TPRG1 gene and 11q13.3 including the CTTN, PPFIA1and SHANK2 genes. There was no significant homozygous loss and the most recurrent hemizygous deletion involved the B3GAT1 gene on chromosome11q25. Focal gains on 11q13.3 in 37% of cases (19/51), consistently involved CTTN and SHANK2 genes. Twelve of these cases (23,5%), had a broader region of gain that also included the CCND1, FGF19, FGF4 and FGF3 genes. SHANK2 and CTTN are co-amplified in several cancers, these proteins interact functionally together and are involved in cell motility. Immunohistochemistry confirmed both Shank2 (79%) and cortactin (69%) protein overexpression in samples with gains of these genes. In contrast, cyclin D1 (65%) was moderately expressed in samples with CCND1 DNA gain.

Deletion of the CTCF binding site located at -31 Kb upstream of TAL1 (-31CBS) reduces chromatin accessibility in the +51 enhancer and the TAL1 promoter I, and blocks long-range interaction between the +51 erythroid enhancer and TAL1 promoter 1b that inhibits expression of TAL1 in erythroid cells, but not in T-ALL cells.

We show that the UHRF1 TTD binds LIG1K126me2 with high affinity and selectivity compared to other known methyllysine readers. Notably, and unlike H3K9me2/me3, the UHRF1 plant homeodomain (PHD) and its N-terminal linker (L2) do not contribute to multivalent LIG1K126me2 recognition along with the TTD. To test the functional significance of this interaction, we designed a LIG1K126me2 cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Consistent with LIG1 knockdown in somatic cells, uptake of the CPP had no effect on the DNA methylation maintenance function of UHRF1. Further, we did not detect changes in bulk DNA methylation after chemical or genetic disruption of lysine methyltransferase activity. Collectively, these studies identify UHRF1 as a selective reader of LIG1K126me2 in vitro, implicate the UHRF1 TTD as a dispensable domain for DNA methylation maintenance, and call into question existing models of methyllysine-dependent DNA methylation maintenance in somatic cancer cells.",Homo sapiens,DNA methylation analysis of HCT116 after disruption of methyllysine reading and writing.

However, little is known about the role of methylation in regulating the antiproliferation activity of C/EBPα. Here, we report that knockdown of protein arginine methyltransferases 1 (PRMT1) leads to cellular growth arrest accompanied by a decrease in Cyclin D1 gene expression in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we reveal that C/EBPα is methylated by PRMT1 at three arginine residues (R35, R156, and R165), which impairs the interaction of C/EBPα with HDAC3 and modulates the transcription activity of C/EBPα and Cyclin D1 gene expression. PRMT1 is upregulated in human breast cancer, and elevated PRMT1 is correlated with cancer malignancy. Most importantly, a specific inhibitor of PRMT1 significantly impedes the growth of cancer cells from triple-negative breast cancer patients. Our data demonstrate that high expression of PRMT1 promotes the expression of Cyclin D1 through methylation of C/EBPα to interfere with the repressive function of HDAC3, which leads to rapid growth of tumor cells during the pathogenesis of breast cancer. This evidence that PRMT1 mediates C/EBPα methylation sheds light on a novel therapeutic pathway for breast cancer.",Homo sapiens,Manuscript title: C/EBPα is methylated by PRMT1 to regulate Cyclin D1 gene transcription in human breast cancer

While the Mevalonate pathway (MVA) is suggested to promote cell growth and survival, including in HER2+ models, its potential role in resistance to HER2-targeted therapy is unknown. Using HER2+ breast cancer parental (P) cell models (AU565, SKBR3, and UACC812), we have established anti-HER2-resistant derivatives made resistant to lapatinib (LR) or lapatinib plus trastuzumab (LTR). We performed RNA-seq on these resistant models and the P cells treated with lapatinib or lapatinib plus trastuzumaba for 24 h. We found that the average expression of the key genes in the MVA pathway, as a surrogate for pathway activity, was dramatically reduced in P cells with short-term treatment. In contrast, expression was restored or further upregulated relative to P cells in all three resistant (LR/LTR) models. Specific blockade of this pathway with lipophilic but not hydrophilic statins and with the n-bisphosphonate zoledronic acid led to apoptosis and substantial growth inhibition of resistant cells. Inhibition was rescued by mevalonate or the intermediate metabolites farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by cholesterol. Activated YAP/TAZ and mTORC1 signaling and their downstream target gene product Survivin were inhibited by MVA blockade especially in the LR/LTR models. Overexpression of constitutively active YAP rescued Survivin and phosphorylated S6 levels despite blockade of the MVA. The MVA may provide alternative signaling leading to cell survival and resistance when HER2 is blocked by activating YAP/TAZ-mTORC1-Survivin signaling suggesting novel therapeutic targets. MVA inhibitors including lipophilic statins and N-bisphosphonates may circumvent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy and warrant further clinical investigation.",Homo sapiens,Targeting the mevalonate pathway to overcome acquired anti-HER2 treatment resistance in breast cancer [RNA-seq]

The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived constitutively active RhoC mutant (Q63E) overexpressed bladder cancer cells (T24) transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) methods and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis Methods: Bladder cancer cells mRNA profiles of vector(VEC) and RhoC constitutively active mutant (Q63E) stably expressing T24 cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeqX Ten. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with the method: Hisat2 2.1.0 followed by StringTie. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 50 million sequence reads per sample to the hunam reference genome and identified 209,506 transcripts in the vector(VEC) and constitutively active RhoC mutant (Q63E) transduced bladder cancer cells (T24 cells) with Hisat2 2.1.0 workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of known housekeeping genes. Approximately 3% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the vector(VEC) and constitutively active RhoC mutant (Q63E) transduced bladder cancer cells (T24 cells), with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 13 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to RhoC function in bladder cancer. Data analysis with Hisat2 2.1.0 workflow revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of constitutively active RhoC mutant (Q63E) overexpressed bladder cancer cells transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.

Here we report a critical function and novel mechanism of action of KDM1A in glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated gene transcription. Biochemical purification of the nuclear GR complex revealed KDM1A as an integral component. In cell-free assays, GR modulates KDM1A-catalyzed H3K4 progressive demethylation by limiting loss of H3K4me1. Similarly, in cells KDM1A binds to most GR binding sites where it removes preprogrammed H3K4me2 but leaves H3K4me1 untouched. Blocking KDM1A catalytic activity prevents H3K4me2 removal, severely impairs GR binding to chromatin, and dysregulates GR-targeted genes. Taken together, these data suggest KDM1A-mediated H3K4me2 demethylation at GRBSs promotes GR binding and plays an important role in glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription, offering a new mechanism contributing to nuclear receptor mediated gene activation.",Homo sapiens,GR and LSD1/KDM1A-targeted gene activation requires selective H3K4me2 demethylation at enhancers

As a consequence, there has been growing interest in the development of miRNAs not only as diagnostic biomarkers of cancer but also as a promising new class of therapeutic agents. Over the last several years, our laboratory has focused on analysis of the molecular processes underlying the ability of individual miRNAs to induce mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) particularly in ovarian cancer. Ectopic over expression of specific miRNAs down regulated during epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) have previously been reported to induce MET in a variety of cancer cells, thereby reducing metastatic potential and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapies. Interestingly, the ability of individual miRNAs to induce MET when over expressed in cancer cells is often cancer/cell-type specific. In an effort to better understand the molecular processes underlying this specificity, we examined the molecular and phenotypic responses of three mesenchymal-like cancer cell lines (two ovarian and one prostate) to ectopic over expression of three sequentially divergent miRNAs previously implicated in the EMT/MET process. The ability of these sequentially divergent miRNAs to induce MET in these cells was found to be associated with inherent differences in the starting molecular profiles of the untreated cancer cells and specifically, variability in trans-regulatory controls modulating the expression of genes targeted by the individual miRNAs. While our results support the view that miRNAs have significant potential as cancer therapeutic agents, our findings further indicate that optimal treatments will likely need to be personalized with respect to the molecular profiles of the individual cancers being treated.",Homo sapiens,MiRNA-mediated induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) between cancer cell types is significantly modulated by inter-cellular molecular variability

In addition to genetic mutations, epigenetic abnormalities are involved in the whole process of MM relapse and drug resistance. In this study, we investigate the roles of polycomb like protein 19 (PHF19), a critical gene involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in the development of MM. The gene expression profiling (GEP) data shows that PHF19 is significantly up-regulated in MM cells and associated with shortened progression-free survival and overall survival in MM patients. PHF19 promotes MM cell growth both in vitro and in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Up-regulated PHF19 is also associated with the development of resistance to multiple drugs, including bortezomib, in MM cells. Moreover, miR-15a can directly target PHF19 by binding to its 3'-UTR. Since miR-15a is down-regulated in MM cells, PHF19 is considered to be up-regulated due to loss of the suppression by miR-15a. The mechanistic investigations indicate that PHF19 can activate AKT which in turn leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of EZH2, a core component of PRC2 that mediates the histone H3K27 methylation. Subsequently suppresses histone H3K27 methylation and causes up-regulated expression of several anti-apoptotic genes, including BCL-xL, MCL-1 and HIF-1alpha.

Here we focused on investigating PRMT4 (also called coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1, CARM1) due to its high expression and the associated poor prognosis in ERa-positive breast cancers. We first uncovered the chromatin-binding landscape and transcriptional targets of CARM1 in the presence of estrogen in ERa-positive breast cancer cells employing genomic and transcriptomics approaches. CARM1 was found to be predominantly and specifically recruited to ERa-bound active enhancers and essential for the transcriptional activation of cognate estrogen-induced gene transcriptional activation in response to estrogen. Global mapping of CARM1 substrates revealed that CARM1 methylates a large cohort of proteins with diverse biological functions, including regulation of intracellular estrogen receptor signaling, chromatin organization, chromatin remodeling and others. Intriguingly, a number of proteins were hypermethylated exclusively by CARM1 on a cluster of arginine residues. Exemplified by MED12, hypermethylation of these proteins by CARM1 served as a molecular beacon for recruiting coactivator protein, tudor domain-containing 3 (TDRD3), to ensure the full activation of estrogen/ERa target genes. In consistent with its critical role in estrogen-induced gene transcriptional activation, CARM1 was found to promote cell proliferation of ERa-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in mice.

Previously we identified the mannose receptor LY75 as the cellular phenotype modulator.

Consecutive Venn diagram analysis of the DMRs data from the of the three experimental combinations revealed 6666 genes, displaying common altered DMRs in their exons/promoter regions, following LY75-mediated EMT alterations in EOC cells. Based on the 6666 gene list, we further proceeded with a more stringent selection of genes displaying rather high degree (>70%) of methylation in their promoter regions and previously shown to be implicated in cancer-related EMT signaling. Our stringent selection retained 45 genes (see Supplemental Table 1E), as the DNA methylation status of the promoter regions of most of these genes was further validated by an alternative approach (BSP sequencing).

We performed transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected prior to HSCT and at onset of TA-TMA and observed significant up-regulation of classical and alternative complement pathways during active TA-TMA. At resolution of TA-TMA after eculizumab therapy, essentially all up-regulated genes and pathways returned to baseline expression levels, supporting the clinical practice of successfully discontinuing complement blockade after resolution of TA-TMA.

We performed polysomal profiling in the cell lines SJSA1 and HCT116, of which only the first undergoes robust cell death in response to p53 activation by Nutlin. We establish Nutlin-induced apoptosis in SJSA1 cells to be associated with a set of translationally enhanced mRNAs carrying a newly identified 3’UTR motif which we labeled CG-motif. We identified PCBP2 and DHX30 as interactor proteins of the CG-motif that are more abundant in HCT116 cells compared to SJSA1. The binding of DHX30 to the CG-motif detected in HCT116 cells was shown to be dependent on PCBP2. Interestingly, DHX30 depletion enhances polysome association of CG-motif mRNAs in HCT116 cells, shifting their outcome towards apoptosis. In U2OS, an osteosarcoma-derived cell line that unlike SJSA1 undergoes persistent cell cycle arrest in response to Nutlin, DHX30 is highly expressed and its depletion enhances the expression of CG-motif mRNAs.",Homo sapiens,p53-induced apoptosis is specified by a translation program regulated by PCBP2 and DHX30.

However, in CLL-like monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) studies are scarce. Herein, a comprehensive characterization of the microenvironment in 59 MBL, 56 early stage CLL and 31 healthy controls was conducted. Gene expression arrays and qRT-PCR were performed on RNA from CD4+ peripheral blood cells; serum cytokines were measured by immunoassays and proteomic studies; and flow cytometry was applied to evaluate peripheral blood cytotoxic, Th1, exhausted and effector CD4+ T cells, besides monocytic CD14, CD4 and HLA-DR expression. MBL and early stage CLL showed a similar upregulation of cytotoxic and Th1-related genes, expanded perforin+ and CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells as well as PD1+ CD4+ T cells compared to controls. However, a strong inflammatory response was only identified in MBL: enhanced phagocytosis, pattern recognition receptors, IL8, HMGB1, TREM1 and acute response signaling pathways, along with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (remarkably IL8, IFN? and TNF?). Of note, this inflammatory drive was decreased in early stage CLL: diminished proinflammatory cytokines including IFN?, decreased IL8 signaling pathway and lower monocytic HLA-DR expression compared to MBL. Besides, this inflammation was especially reduced in IGHV mutated CLL, involving a decrease of the proinflammatory HMGB1 signaling pathway.

Polo like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a key mitotic kinase which controls centrosome separation. Here we found that Plk1 phosphorylated residue Thr76 in VCP/p97, an AAA-ATPase mainly involved in protein homeostasis, at centrosome from prophase to anaphase. This phosphorylation recruited VCP to centrosome to regulate centrosome orientation. VCP also exhibited strong co-localization with Eg5, a mitotic kinesin motor for centrosome movement, at mitotic spindle, and dephosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP was required for the enrichment of VCP and Eg5 to the spindle, thus, ensuring proper spindle orientation and chromosome segregation. Since genome instability is the hallmark of cancer and the phosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP is important for proper centrosome movement, spindle orientation, and chromosome segregation, we, thus, knocked down VCP in MDA-MB-231cells by its specific shRNA, and reconstituted the expression of VCP by infecting the cells with lentivirus encoding shRNA-resistant Flag-VCPWT or Flag-VCPT76A. We then implanted VCPWT- or VCPT76A-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice and found that the tumor growth in mice implanted with VCPT76A-expressing cells was significantly slower when compared with the mice implanted with the Flag-VCPWT-expressing cells.

Although it was discovered over 70 years ago, our understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus remains limited. We used RNA-Seq in two human liver cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) infected with CCHFV (strain Ib 10200), to examine kinetic changes in host expression and viral replication simultaneously at 24 and 72 hours post infection. Through this, numerous host pathways were identified that were modulated by the virus including: antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. Notably, DDX60, a cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. Interestingly, the PTPRR gene was induced in Huh7 cells. This has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade, and polymorphisms in the TLR9 gene have been associated with poor outcomes in patients. Additionally, we whole-genome sequenced CCHFV to assess viral diversity over time, and its relationship to the host response. As a result, we have demonstrated that through next-generation mRNA deep-sequencing it is possible to not only examine mRNA gene expression, but also to examine viral evolution.

With any targeted therapy, there is always the risk that tumors will become resistant and stop responding to treatment. Here, we investigated resistance mechanisms to YK-4-279 (YK) by developing ES cell lines specifically resistant to YK. We found that expression of the cell surface protein CD99 was elevated in YK-resistant cells. Increased CD99 expression occurs within five days of YK treatment in vivo. When CD99 expression is reduced by shRNA, resistant cells regain sensitivity to YK but reducing CD99 expression in non-resistant cells does not affect sensitivity. Little is known about CD99 function in the context of Ewing sarcoma, but the data presented here indicates the function of CD99 is altered upon acquisition of YK resistance, and that CD99 serves a critical function in developed resistance to YK-4-279. RNA sequencing analysis yielded candidate genes that may also be involved in the YK resistance mechanism.

Yet, TCF7L2 belongs to the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC), and growth inhibitory functions of TCF7L2 were proposed. This apparent paradox calls for a clarification of the role of TCF7L2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated TCF7L2 dependence/independence of CRC cells, and the cellular and molecular consequences of TCF7L2 loss-of-function. By genome editing we readily achieved complete TCF7L2 inactivation in several CRC cell lines without loss of viability, showing that CRC cells have widely lost the strict requirement for TCF7L2. Albeit phenotypic changes manifested in a cell-line-specific fashion, TCF7L2-negative cells exhibited morphological changes, enhanced migration and invasion, and augmented collagen adhesion. Additionally, TCF7L2 deficiency led to reduced proliferation, reminiscent of the physiological role of TCF7L2. To provide a molecular framework for the observed phenotypic changes, we performed global transcriptome profiling. This identified gene-regulatory networks in which TCF7L2 positively regulates the proto-oncogene MYC, while repressing the cell cycle inhibitors CDKN2C/CDKN2D. TCF7L2 also suppresses the pro-metastatic transcription factor RUNX2 and several integrin genes, which is consistent with increased motility and collagen adhesion of TCF7L2-deficient cells. Altogether, we conclude that the proliferation-stimulating activity of TCF7L2 persists in CRC cells. Additionally, TCF7L2 acts as invasion suppressor.

However, our understanding of the role of histones in gene regulation is far from complete, in part due to newly discovered novel histone modifications, whose functions are yet to be uncovered1. Here we report that histone H3 lysine 27 crotonylation (H3K27cr) is selectively recognized by the YEATS domain of GAS41 in association with SIN3a-HDAC1/2 co-repressor complex for gene transcriptional repression. The GAS41 YEATS domain dimer binds proto-oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, which recruits GAS41/SIN3a-HDAC1/2 complex to target gene loci in chromatin such as cell cycle inhibitor p21. Transcriptional de-repression of p21, directed by tumor suppressor p53 upon doxorubicin stimulation, entails dissociation of c-Myc/GAS41/SIN3a-HDAC1/2 complex from chromatin, reduced H3K27 crotonylation, and consequentially increased H3K27 acetylation at p21 locus. GAS41 knockout or H3K27cr binding depletion with CRISPR/Cas9 results in p21 activation, cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition in mice.

Using genome-wide methylation sequencing and poly(A)-sequencing we identified a correlation between DNA methylation and APA. As such, we sought to define the mechanism regulating this relationship.

APA can result in transcripts with varying length and information content, and has been linked to gene regulation in both cancer and development. While trans-acting regulatory factors can cause changes in APA, the process of cleavage and polyadenylation is often co-transcriptional. We hypothesized that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, may regulate APA co-transcriptionally. To identify genes where DNA methylation may regulate APA, we performed a genome-wide quantification of polyA site usage using a next generation sequencing technique. By priming the polyA-tails of an RNA library, we mapped cleavage sites and abundances with base-pair resolution across the genomes of two cell lines. The HCT116 cell line is derived from colon cancer, and contains cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation. The DKO cell line is derived from the parental HCT116 line, but has a near-complete depletion of DNA methylation due to mutations in DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Previous studies have used this sytem to detect genes where promoter DNA methylation regulates the gene expression of tumor suppressors. Analogously, detecting APA between HCT116 and DKO reveals candidate genes where DNA methylation may regulate the process of APA.

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human oncogenic gamma-2 herpesvirus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphoproliferative diseases of B-cell origin such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). It is well characterized that KSHV utilizes host epigenetic and nuclear machineries to control the switch between two life cycles, latency and lytic replication. However, how KSHV impacts the host epigenome at different stages of viral life cycle is not well understood. Using the analysis of global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we profiled the dynamics of host transcriptional regulatory elements during latency and lytic replication of KSHV-infected PEL cells. This study showed that a number of critical host genes for KSHV latency, including MYC proto-oncogene, were under the control of super-enhancers and eRNAs that were globally repressed upon viral reactivation. A combination of circular chromosome conformation capture combined with sequencing (4C-seq), GRO-seq and ChIP-seq indicated that the eRNA-expressing super-enhance regions were located at downstream of the MYC gene in KSHV-infected PELs. Treatment of an epigenetic drug to block enhancer function or shRNA-mediated depletion of the eRNA expression significantly reduced MYC mRNA expression in KSHV-infected PELs. Finally, while cellular IRF4 acted upon the eRNAs and super-enhancers for MYC expression during latency, the KSHV viral IRF4 repressed cellular IRF4 expression upon reactivation, decreasing MYC expression and thereby, facilitating lytic replication.

Methods: EVs from three groups of samples, healthy controls (CT), luminal A (LA), and triple negative (TNBC), were isolated from serum using a precipitation method and analyzed by RNA-seq (screening phase). Subsequently, four EV-miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-320a, and miR-4433b-5p) were selected to be quantified by RT-qPCR in individual samples (test phase). Results: A panel composed of miR-142-5p, miR-320a, and miR-4433b-5p discriminated BC patients from CT with an AUC of 0.8387 (93.33% sensitivity, 68.75% specificity). In addition, the combination of miR-142-5p and miR-320a, presented an AUC of 0.941 (100% sensitivity, 93.80% specificity) in distinguishing LA patients from CT.

High resolution transcriptomics was used to decipher EV71-host interactions in PBMCs. Ingenuity analyses revealed similar pathways triggered by all EV71 isolates, although the extent of activation varied. Importantly, several pathways were found to be specific to the severe isolate, including triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) signaling.

PHF19 is also overexpressed in many cancers. However, neither PHF19 targets in cancer cells nor potentially misregulated pathways involving PHF19 are known. Here, we investigate the role of PHF19 in prostate cancer cells. We find that PHF19 interacts with PRC2 and binds to PRC2 targets on chromatin. Direct PHF19 target genes are involved in proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization, among others. Depletion of PHF19 triggers an increase in MTF2/PCL2 recruitment to chromatin, along with a genome-wide gain in PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 deposition. Transcriptome analysis shows that loss of PHF19 promotes deregulation of key genes involved in growth, metastasis, and invasion, as well as of factors that stimulate formation of new blood vessels. Consistent with this, PHF19 silencing reduces cell proliferation rate and promotes invasive growth and angiogenesis.

We report a second family with two siblings with a homozygous frameshift mutation in MKL1. The index case deceased as an infant from progressive and severe pneumonia by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor wound healing. The younger sib was preemptively transplanted shortly after birth. The immunodeficiency was marked by a pronounced actin polymerization defect and a strongly reduced motility and chemotactic response by MKL1-deficient neutrophils. Apart from the lack of MKL1, subsequent proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of patient neutrophils revealed actin and several actin-related proteins to be downregulated, confirming a role for MKL1 as transcriptional co-regulator. Degranulation was enhanced upon suboptimal neutrophil activation, while production of reactive oxygen species was normal. Neutrophil adhesion was intact but without proper spreading. The latter could explain the observed failure in firm adherence and transendothelial migration under flow conditions. No apparent defect in phagocytosis and bacterial killing was found. Also monocyte-derived macrophages showed intact phagocytosis; lymphocyte counts and proliferative capacity were normal. Non-hematopoietic primary patient fibroblasts demonstrated defective differentiation into myofibroblasts but normal migration and filamentous actin (F-actin) content, most probably due to compensatory mechanisms of MKL2, which is not expressed in neutrophils.

In this study, we conducted a systematic shRNA library screen, focusing of epigenetic modifiers linked to stem-cell reprogramming, in LNCaP-abl cells, a model of CRPC. Amongst the shRNA hits, KDM3B, a histone H3K9 demethylase, was identified to have the most significant anti-proliferative effect on LNCaP-abl cells. KDM3B CRISPR/Cas9 knockout phenocopied the shRNA treatment, proving the observed phenotype was not due to shRNA off-target effects. Interestingly, this decrease in proliferation was remarkably specific to androgen-independent cells. Additionally, genetic rescue experiment showed that only enzymatically active KDM3B recovers the phenotype. No alterations in the cell cycle distribution or expression of AR downstream effectors were observed, but RNASeq revealed subtle changes in the genes expression profile for cells treated with KDM3A shRNA, including in metabolome-related enzymes such as ARG2, RDH11.

We included tumors and paired normal tissue from 58 patients for TMB analysis using RNA-seq. Forty-six tumors were MSI-H (29 with a DNA MMR germline mutation and 17 with MLH1 promoter HM) and 12 were MSS. TMB was measured using the expressed somatic nucleotide variants (eTMB). We developed a method that leverages mutational signatures to remove FFPE derived artifact from total eTMB and thereby accurately measure the eTMB. There was a significant difference in the eTMB observed between MSI-H and MSS cases; MSI-H cases had a median of 27.3 mutations/Mb compared to 6.7 mutations/Mb for MSS cases (p=3.5e-9). Among tumors with dMMR the tumors with DNA MMR mutations had a significantly higher eTMB (p=0.037) than tumors with MLH1 promoter HM: a median of 28.1 mutations/Mb vs. a median of 17.5 mutations/Mb. Furthermore, through multivariate analysis we found that MSI status, tissue type (endometrial or colorectal) and patient ages are significantly associated with eTMB.

Here, we find that cellular RNA editing by APOBEC3A can also be induced by influenza or Maraba virus infections in normal macrophages, and by interferons in tumor-associated macrophages.

However, its functionality and transcriptional targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. In the present study, we discovered that the expression of ZNF281 was increased in tumor tissues and cell lines, and positively correlated with vessel invasion in HCC. We took RNA interference approach and constructed 2 shRNAs lentivirus vectors targeting different regions of ZNF281 which were named as ZNF281.kd1 and ZNF281.kd2 respectively. Knockdown of ZNF281 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. In searching for novel ZNF281 regulated genes, RNA-seq was performed on BGI-seq500 platform using the obtained stable cells of Con, ZNF281.kd1 and ZNF281.kd2 in HLE background (each in duplicate). The criteria of log2 FC (fold change) >1.5, and q value <0.001 was set for calling differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Besides, to minimize the off-target effect of single shRNAs, only DEGs that show consistent trend of alteration (up-regulated or down-regulated in both ZNF281.kd1 and ZNF281.kd2 groups against control shRNA group) were selected as potential ZNF281 targets. A list of potential targets was identified, including both up-regulated and down-regulated genes upon ZNF281 depletion. Further mechanistic studies were performed to uncover transcriptional regulation of ZNF281 on these genes. Our study was supposed to be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanism underpinning progression of HCC, and might also hold therapeutic potential for HCC treatment.",Homo sapiens,Transcriptome alteration upon ZNF281 depletion in HCC cells

In 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the t(1,19) chromosomal translocation specifically targets the E2A gene and produces an oncogenic E2A-PBX1 fusion protein. While previous studies have demonstrated oncogenic functions of E2A-PBX1 in cell and animal models, the E2A-PBX1-enforced cistrome, the E2A-PBX1 interactome, and related mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis remain unclear. Here, by unbiased genomic profiling approaches, we identify the direct target sites of E2A-PBX1 in t(1,19)-positive pre-B ALL cells and show that, compared to normal E2A, E2A-PBX1 preferentially binds to a subset of gene loci co-bound by RUNX1 and gene-activating machineries (p300, MED1, and H3K27 acetylation). Using biochemical analyses, we further document a direct interaction between E2A-PBX1 and RUNX1 and show that E2A-PBX1 binding to gene enhancers is dependent on RUNX1, but not the DNA-binding activity harbored within the PBX1 homeodomain of E2A-PBX1. Transcriptome analyses and cell transformation assays further establish a significant RUNX1 requirement for E2A-PBX1-mediated target gene activation and leukemogenesis. Notably, the RUNX1 locus itself is also directly activated by E2A-PBX1, indicating a multilayered interplay between E2A-PBX1 and RUNX1. Collectively, our study provides the first unbiased profiling of the E2A-PBX1 cistrome in pre-B ALL cells and reveals a previously unappreciated pathway in which E2A-PBX1 acts in concert with RUNX1 to enforce transcriptome alterations for the development of pre-B ALL.",Homo sapiens,Genome-wide maps of factors and gene expression in pre-B leukemic 697 line

Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of RAS-mutant tumors, creating a dependency on key metabolic pathways. This dependency could be leveraged to combat these tumors. We discovered that abrogation of S6K2, a mTORC1 effector, triggers accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids, lipid peroxidation and cell death selectively in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells that are resistant to MAPK inhibition. S6K2 depletion induced upregulation of S6K1 and PPAR, triggering apoptotic and ferroptosis-like cell death. Conversely, depletion of S6K1 diminished lipid synthesis and cell proliferation, without eliciting cell death.

ATP-binding cassette member B5 (ABCB5) has been identified as a molecular marker for distinct subsets of chemoresistant tumor-initiating cell populations in diverse human malignancies. In the current study, we examined the potential role of ABCB5 in growth and chemoresistance of GBM.

Likewise, in an in vivo GBM xenograft study in immunodeficient mice, anti-ABCB5 monoclonal antibody treatment inhibited tumor growth and sensitized tumors to TMZ therapy. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ABCB5 regulates cell cycle checkpoint molecules to revoke drug-induced G2-M arrest and augments drug-mediated cell death.

Here, we identified a novel alternative splice of Oral Cancer Overexpressed 1 (ORAOV1), ORAOV1-B, which was subsequently validated as an lncRNA and correlated with OSCC lymph node metastasis; significantly increased invasion and migration were observed in ORAOV1-B-overexpressed OSCC cells; In the metastatic model, ORAOV1-B also significantly contributed to OSCC-related lung metastasis. cDNA microarrays was performed to compare up- or down-regulated genes in EV and ORAOV1-B sets of OSCC, which suggested TNFα as a potential downstream of ORAOV1-B and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, indicating the activation of NF-κB pathway. In summary, the novel splice variant ORAOV1-B is an lncRNA, which significantly potentiates OSCC invasion and metastasis by binding to Hsp90 and activating the NF-κB-TNFα loop.

To investigate a potential role of circRNAs in the p53 pathway, we analyzed RNA-seq data from colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, RKO and SW48) in the presence or absence of DNA damage. Surprisingly, unlike the strong p53-dependent induction of hundreds of p53-induced mRNAs, only a few circRNAs were induced from the p53-induced genes. Circ-MDM2, an annotated circRNA from the MDM2 locus, was one of the handful of circRNAs that originated from a p53-induced gene. Given the central role of MDM2 in suppressing p53 protein levels and p53 activity, we investigated the function of circ-MDM2. Knocking down circ-MDM2 with siRNAs that targeted the circ-MDM2 junction and had no effect on linear MDM2 mRNA, resulted in increased basal p53 levels and growth defects in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these results, transcriptome profiling showed increased expression of several direct p53 targets, reduced Rb phosphorylation and defects in G1-S progression upon silencing circ-MDM2.

IMPDH1 was positively correlated with the metastasis-related gene YB-1, and served as an independent prognostic factor in ccRCC.

It is now widely recognized that this cancer emerges as metastasis from the fallopian tube and the lack of suitable in vitro disease models poses a major obstacle for efforts to improve our understanding of this deadly disease. We used organoids of healthy human FT epithelium as a model for stepwise genetic modification towards malignancy, using shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of three major HGSOC driver genes: P53, PTEN and Retinoblastoma (RB). Moreover, we successfully established patient-derived HGSOC organoids from solid tumor deposits.

Complementary to this finding, we can show that the medium optimized for ovarian cancer organoids also improves the growth of the modified organoid lines, showing that changes within the niche environment are required to promote stemness upon depletion of P53/PTEN/RB.

Thus, the H3K9me3-H3K9ac equilibrium is a crucial feature for maintaining the stemness in GICs and represents a chromatin feature that can be exploited to specifically target this tumor subpopulation.",Homo sapiens,Glioblastoma initiating cells are sensitive to histone demethylase inhibition due to loss of DNA repair capacity

Methods: 231 and Pep-E3 cells' mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with following methods: Alignment by using HISAT2 v2.1, IGV was used to to view the mapping result by the Heatmap, histogram, scatter plot or other stytle, FPKM was then calculated to estimate the expression level of genes in each sample, DEGseq v1.18.0 was used for differential gene expression analysis between two samples with non biological replicates and Function Enrichment Analysis including GO enrichment analysis and KEGG . Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of 231 and Pep-E3 cells' transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.

We and others have shown that several microRNAs, which are ~21-24nt post-transcriptional gene regulators, are aberrantly expressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tissues and cell lines. In the cell, miRNAs are bound to Argonaute (AGO) proteins as low molecular weight RNA Induced Silencing Complexes (LMW-RISCs) that can then assemble into high molecular weight RISCs (HMW-RISCs) that also include additional proteins and mRNA. In this study, we sought to analyze the association of miRNAs across RISC complexity in ATC and PTC. For both ATC and PTC lines, miRNAs were enriched in HMW-RISC and LMW-RISC fractions compared with intermediate fractions or very low molecular weight (AGO-poor) fractions. Furthermore, 60% of all miRNAs were more abundant in LMW-RISC versus HMW- RISC fractions by ~2-4 fold.

The goal of this study was to utilize an unbiased computational approach to identify inhibitors which reverse an experimentally derived BRAFi resistance gene expression signature. Using this approach, we predicted that ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, effectively reverses this signature, and we demonstrate experimentally that ibrutinib re-sensitizes a subset of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells to vemurafenib. Ibrutinib is used clinically as a BTK inhibitor; however, neither BTK deletion nor treatment with acalabrutinib, an analog of ibrutinib with reduced off-target activity, re-sensitized cells to vemurafenib. These data suggest that ibrutinib acts through a BTK-independent mechanism in vemurafenib re-sensitization. To better understand this mechanism, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of ibrutinib-treated BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells and found that the transcriptional profile of ibrutinib was highly similar to that of multiple SRC kinase inhibitors. Since ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib, has significant off-target activity against multiple SRC family kinases, it suggests that ibrutinib may be acting through this mechanism. Furthermore, genes either upregulated or downregulated by ibrutinib treatment are enriched with YAP1 target genes and we experimentally demonstrate that ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib, reduces YAP1 activity in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that ibrutinib, or other SRC family kinase inhibitors, may be useful for treating some BRAFi/MEKi-refractory melanoma tumors.",Homo sapiens,Ibrutinib blocks YAP1 activation and reverses BRAFi resistance in melanoma cells

Purpose: Here we validate the proposed pathogenic function of the menin-MLL interaction in cancer with a novel probe inhibitor BAY-155. Methods: RNA-seq was used to investigate transcriptional effects of novel BAY-155 probe in thirteen cell lines from a range of solid tumor types. Results: Menin-MLL inhibition by BAY-155 in colorectal (SW1463, LoVo, DLD-1), prostate (22RV1, LNCaP, VCaP), pancreas (PANC-1, MiaPaCa2), breast (BT-474, ZR-75-1, MCF7), bladder (JMSU-1) and kidney (G401) tissue derived cancer cell lines resulted in moderate gene expression changes. Surprisingly, for the reported role of MLL1 as a co-activator of gene expression, inhibition by BAY-155 led predominantly to up-regulation of genes. We could not observe any evidences of an overarching, menin driven expression program, which is in contrast to previous reports for e.g. the Hox gene cluster. Conclusions: Our study adds important critical validation data to the menin-MLL interaction as therapeutic target in solid cancers.

The LrS attenuated both TNF-α- and STS-induced gene expression involved in NF-κB and MAPK activation, as well as expression of genes involved in other immune-related signaling pathways. Specifically, the LrS induced the expression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3), negative regulators of innate immune signaling, in HT-29 IECs challenged with TNF-α or STS. TNF-α and STS-induced acetylation of H3 and H4 histones was attenuated by the LrS, as was the production of TNF-α and STS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, the LrS induced production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine involved in host-microbe interactions at the gut interface. We propose that the LrS attenuates pro-inflammatory mediator expression through increased transcription of negative regulators of innate immune activity and changes in global H3 and H4 histone acetylation.

AZD1775 is a small molecule inhibitor of WEE1, currently in early phase clinical trials as a single agent and in combination with more conventional anti-neoplastic agents. As resistance to kinase inhibitors is frequent, we sought to identify mechanisms of resistance to WEE1 inhibition in acute leukemia. We found that AZD1775 resistant cell lines are dependent upon increased HDAC activity for their survival, in part due to increased KDM5A activity. In addition, gene expression analyses demonstrate HDAC dependent increase in MYC expression and c-MYC activity in AZD1775 treated resistant cells. Overexpression of c-MYC confers resistance to AZD1775 in cell lines with low base line expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4, and thereby c-MYC, partially abrogated resistance to AZD1775.

Results: HDAC7 knockdown by a pool of siRNAs resulted in altered expression of nearly three times the genes in BPLER vs. HMLER cells (2545 vs. 763), with the two cell types sharing altered expression of 328 genes. In stem-like BPLER cells, HDAC7 knockdown caused significant alterations in gene expression (1068 down and 1477 up). Fewer genes, less than half of BPLER, were altered in non-stem HMLER cells (448 down and 315 up), with 199 repressed and 129 activated genes shared between the two cell types. In contrast, 72h HDAC1 knockdown resulted in nearly equal numbers of altered genes in BPLER vs. HMLER cells (3187 vs. 2627), with the two cell types sharing altered expression of 637 genes. Moreover, the number of repressed (1570 vs. 1307) and activated (1617 vs. 1320) gene transcripts was similar in the two cell types In HMLER cells, HDAC7 knockdown resulted in alterations of significantly fewer gene transcripts compared to HDAC1 knockdown (508 vs. 2681), in both repressed (305 vs. 1362) and activated (203 vs. 1319) transcripts.

To investigate the genetic dependencies of imipridone action, we screened a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library in the presence of either ONC201 or its more potent analog ONC212. Loss of the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP or the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase MIPEP conferred strong resistance to both compounds. Biochemical and surrogate genetic assays showed that impridones directly activate CLPP and that MIPEP is necessary for proteolytic maturation of CLPP into a catalytically competent form. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cells treated with ONC212 revealed degradation of many mitochondrial as well as non-mitochondrial proteins. Prompted by the conservation of ClpP from bacteria to humans, we found that the imipridones also activate ClpP from Escherichia coli, B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus in biochemical and genetic assays. ONC212 and acyldepsipeptide (ADEP)-4, a known activator of bacterial ClpP, caused similar proteome-wide degradation profiles in S. aureus.

When compared to existing retrospective lineage tracing methods, RETrace achieved higher accuracy (88% triplet accuracy from an ex vivo HCT116 tree) at a higher cell division resolution (lowering the required number of cell division difference between single cells by approximately 100 divisions). Simultaneously, RETrace demonstrated the ability to capture on average 150,000 unique CpGs per single cell in order to accurately determine cell type.

We used R language edgeR package screened the expression profiles of 374 tissue samples obtained from patients with HCC and 50 samples of normal liver tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Focusing on DDX24, we explored the functional effect and clinical significance of DDX24 in HCC. We provided evidence that DDX24 was a potential pro-tumorigenic gene in HCC. DDX24 knockdown inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RFX8 was proved to be DDX24 promoter-binding protein that transcriptionally upregulated DDX24 expression.

Methods: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, we identified candidate serum exosomal miRNA markers for early detection of GC in patients. The candidates were further validated by qRT-PCR in 50 newly recruited early-stage GC patients and matched healthy individuals. Results: NGS revealed that the average mappable reads in the RNA libraries were about 6.5 million per patient. A total of 66 up and 13 down-regulated exosomal miRNAs were found in the screened cohort after removal of log2 transformed read counts <5 and p >0.05. In the validation cohort, by comparing candidate exosomal miRNAs levels in early-stage GC patients and healthy individuals, higher levels of miR-92b-3p, let-7g-5p, miR-146b-5p and miR-9-5p were found to be significantly associated with GC. Diagnostic power of the combined panels of the exosomal miRNAs or the combination of exosomal miRNAs and CEA outperformed that of single exosomal miRNA marker for establishing a diagnosis of early-stage GC. In addition, serum levels of exosomal miR-92b-3p were significantly associated with low adhesion, let-7g-5p and miR-146b-5p were significantly correlated with nerve infiltration, and miR146b-5p was statistically correlated with tumor invasion depth in early-stage GC. Conclusions: Serum exosomal miR-92b-3p, -146b-5p, -9-5p, and let-7g-5p may serve as potential noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of GC.

Mechanically, it was confirmed that lncRNA NR-104098 may effectively inhibit EZH2 transcription by directly binding E2F1 and recruiting E2F1 to EZH2 promoter. In addition, ATPR can significantly increase the expression of lncRNA NR-104098, whereas knocking down NR104098 can inhibit the inhibitory effect of ATPR on the proliferation and induction differentiation of AML cells.

We employed whole exome sequencing, together with in vitro assays of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) signalling and response, including RNA sequencing, in patient fibroblasts. We identified a novel de novo heterozygous variant in TNFAIP3, which encodes A20 - a key negative regulator of the NF-κB transcriptional induction pathway.

The eccDNAs identified in cell lines were validated by inverse PCR on DNA that survives exonuclease digestion of linear DNA, and by metaphase FISH.

In genetic toxicology, the use of metabolically competent human hepatocyte cell culture models provides clear advantages over other more commonly used cell lines that require the use of external metabolic activation systems, such as rat liver S9. In this study, we assessed the performance of the flow cytometry in vitro micronucleus test and the TGx-DDI transcriptomic biomarker (to detect DNA damage-inducing chemicals) analyzed by high-throughput sequencing in human HepaRG™ cells. HepaRG™ are metabolically competent cells that express Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes and differentiate into mature hepatocyte-like cells, making them ideal for toxicity testing, in addition to their suitability as an alternative to primary human hepatocytes. HepaRG™ cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 10 prototype test chemicals (six genotoxic chemicals, including one aneugen, and four non-genotoxic chemicals). Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were measured using the In Vitro MicroFlow kit, which was run in parallel with the TGx-DDI transcriptomic biomarker. The biomarker is a panel of genes that is altered in a predictable way following exposure to genotoxic agents and it accurately classifies chemicals as DNA damage-inducing (DDI) or non-DDI in human TK6 cells. The TGx-DDI biomarker was analyzed in HepaRG™ cells using Ion AmpliSeq™ whole transcriptome sequencing in this study to test the ability of the biomarker to accurately classify chemicals using a different human cell line and gene expression technology. All ten chemicals were accurately classified by pairing these test methods. This next generation approach is in line with the paradigm shift occurring in the field of genetic toxicology. It provides mechanistic insight into the assessment of genomic damage and is amenable to quantitative concentration-response analysis and point-of-departure (PoD) determination to establish the potential for adverse health effects.

Spliceosome modulation was invisible to RNA or protein abundance alone. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated broad-scale intron retention suggestive of PI-specific splicing interference.

However, therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells targeting other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors are not yet satisfactory. Although inefficient tumor trafficking and multiple immunosuppressive molecules impede CAR-T cell effector responses, signals delivered by the current CAR constructs may still be insufficient to fully activate antitumor T cell functions. Optimal T cell activation and proliferation requires multiple signals including T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (signal 1), costimulation (signal 2), and cytokine engagement (signal 3).

However, identifying the causal variants is challenging due to linkage disequilibrium amongst variants in the same haplotype block. In this study, we aim to identify functional SNPs in key regulatory regions that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. The majority of disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located in regulatory regions, which can result in allele-specific binding (ASB) of transcription factors and differential expression of the target gene alleles. Here, we present regSNPs-ASB, a generalized linear model-based approach to accurately identify regulatory SNPs that are located in transcription factor binding sites from ATAC-seq data. Results: Using regSNPs-ASB, we identified 53 regulatory SNPs in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and 125 regulatory SNPs in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). By integrating the regSNPs-ASB output with RNA-seq experimental data and publicly available chromatin interaction data from MCF-7 cells, we found that these 53 regulatory SNPs were associated with 74 potential target genes and that 32 (43%) of these genes showed significant allele-specific expression (ASE). By comparing all of the MCF-7 and MSC regulatory SNPs to the eQTLs in the Genome-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project database, we found that 30% (16/53) of the regulatory SNPs in MCF-7 and 43% (52/122) of the regulatory SNPs in MSC were also eQTLs. The enrichment of regulatory SNPs in eQTLs indicated that many of them are likely responsible for allelic differences in gene expression (chi-square test, p-value < 0.01). In sum, we conclude that regSNPs-ASB is a useful tool for identifying causal variants from ATAC-seq data. This new computational tool will enable efficient prioritization of genetic variants identified as eQTL for further studies to validate their causal regulatory function. Ultimately, identifying causal genetic variants will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and the eventual development of potential therapeutic targets.",Homo sapiens,Deciphering Regulatory SNPs from ATAC-seq

Consequently, neurofibromin-depletion causes estradiol hypersensitivity and tamoxifen agonism, explaining the poor prognosis associated with neurofibromin-loss in endocrine therapy-treated ER+ breast cancer. Neurofibromin-deficient ER+ breast cancer cells initially retain sensitivity to selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). However, Ras activation does play a role in acquired SERD resistance, which can be reversed upon MEK inhibitor addition, and SERD/MEK inhibitor combinations induce tumor regression.

As a skin cancer, melanoma is generally resistant to radiotherapy. Hence, there is an urgent need for evaluation of the mechanisms of radioresistance. The present study identified miR-335 as one of the differential expression of miRNAs in recurrent melanoma biopsies post-radiotherapy. The expression of miR-335 declined in melanoma tissues compared to the adjacent tissues. Moreover, miR-335 expression correlated with advanced stages of melanoma negatively. Consistent with the prediction of STARBASE and miRDB database, miR-335 targeted ROCK1 via binding with 3’-UTR of ROCK1 directly, resulting in attenuation of proliferation, migration and radioresistance of melanoma cells. The authors validated that overexpression of miR-335 enhanced X-ray-induced tumor regression by B16 mouse models.

Although FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown clinical responses, the overall outcome of FLT3-ITD+ AML patients remains poor, and most of them would relapse very shortly. TKIs can not eliminate primitive FLT3-ITD+ AML cells, which are potential sources of relapse. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying FLT3-ITD+ AML maintenance and drug resistance is essential to develop novel, effective treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrate that FLT3 inhibition induces histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) upregulation through FOXO1 and FOXO3-mediated transactivation in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Upregulated HDAC8 deacetylates and inactivates p53, leading to leukemia maintenance and drug resistance upon TKIs treatment. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC8 re-activates p53, abrogates leukemia maintenance and significantly enhances TKI-mediated elimination of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Importantly, in FLT3-ITD+ AML patient-derived xenograft models, the combination of FLT3 TKI (AC220) with a HDAC8 inhibitor (22d) significantly inhibits leukemia progression and effectively reduces primitive FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Moreover, we extend these findings to an AML subtype harboring another tyrosine kinase activating mutation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HDAC8 upregulation as an important mechanism to resist TKIs and promote leukemia maintenance, and suggests that combining HDAC8 inhibition with TKI treatment could be a promising strategy to treat FLT3-ITD+ AML and other tyrosine kinase mutation-harboring leukemias.",Homo sapiens,FLT3 inhibition upregulates HDAC8 via FOXO to inactivate p53 and promote maintenance of FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia

Platinum-sensitive models were relatively homogeneous, whereas transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed enrichment of multiple targetable pathways and intertumoral heterogeneity among resistant models.

To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNAseq analyses of chemo-sensitive and -resistant CDXs, as well as longitudinal analyses of CDXs and patient CTCs.

Similarly, serial profiling of patient CTCs directly from blood confirmed increased ITH post-relapse, with gene expression patterns similar to a CDX from the same patient.

We defined an astrocyte subpopulation characterized by expression of the small Maf protein, MAFG, which represses NRF2-driven antioxidant mechanisms and promotes EAE pathogenesis. Mechanistically, MAFG suppresses NRF2-dependent antioxidant genetic programs by cooperating with its cofactor, MAT2a, to promote DNA methylation in the context of CNS inflammation, which in turn increases pathogenic signaling processes in astrocytes. MAFG/MAT2a astrocytes are controlled by GM-CSF signaling, which drives EAE pathogenesis and MAFG expression.

The goal of this study was to establish the global landscape of HGSC tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) using a mass spectrometry pipeline that interrogated all reading frames of all genomic regions. In 23 HGSC tumors, we identified 103 TSAs. Classic TSA discovery approaches focusing only on mutated exonic sequences would have uncovered only three of these TSAs. Other mutated TSAs resulted from out-of-frame exonic translation (n=2) or from noncoding sequences (n=7). One group of TSAs (n=91) derived from aberrantly expressed unmutated genomic sequences, which were not expressed in normal tissues. These aberrantly expressed TSAs (aeTSAs) originated primarily from non-exonic sequences, in particular intronic (29%) and intergenic (22%) sequences. Their expression was regulated at the transcriptional level by variations in gene copy number and DNA methylation. Although mutated TSAs were unique to individual tumors, aeTSAs were shared by a large proportion of HGSCs. Taking into account the frequency of aeTSA expression and HLA allele frequencies, we calculated that, in Caucasians, the median number of aeTSAs per tumor would be five.

Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are longer than 200 bp and without protein-coding ability, are key regulators of tumorigenesis. However, the role of lncRNAs in retinoblastoma remains to be elucidated. METHODS: LncRNA CASC15-New-Transcript 1 (CANT1) expression was determined by real-time PCR in RB cells. Tumor characteristics in CANT1-overexpressing RB cells were determined through CCK8 cell viability assay, soft agar assay and mouse xenograft experiment. RNA transcriptome-sequencing was performed to find downstream target genes of CANT1. CANT1's interactions with phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) were studied through chromatin oligonucleotide precipitation (ChOP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. RESULTS: In this study, we found that the expression of lncRNA CANT1 was significantly downregulated in RB. Notably, CANT1 overexpression significantly inhibited RB growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, lncRNA CANT1, which was mainly located in the nucleus, occupied the promoter of PI3Kγ and blocked histone methyltransferase hSET1 from binding to the PI3Kγ promoter, thus abolishing hSET1-mediated histone H3K4 trimethylation of the PI3Kγ promoter and inhibiting PI3Kγ expression. Furthermore, we found that silencing PI3Kγ either by CANT1 overexpression or by PI3Kγ siRNA, reduced the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and suppressed RB tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA CANT1 acts as a suppressor of RB progression by blocking gene-specific histone methyltransferase recruitment. These findings outline a new CANT1 modulation mechanism and provide an alternative option for RB treatment.",Homo sapiens,Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and CANT1 Overexpression Retinoblastoma Transcriptomes

This hierarchical level of folding is closely associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA replication. Genes within the same folding domain demonstrate similar expression and histone-modification profiles1. Therefore, boundaries separating different domains have important roles in reinforcing the stability of these domain-wide features. Indeed, domain boundary disruptions in human genetic disorders2,3 or human cancers lead to misregulation of certain genes4,5, due to de novo enhancer exposure to promoters. However, the frequency of boundary disruptions in human cancers, and whether there are recurrently affected boundaries in specific cancer types, remains unclear. Here, to understand effects and distributions of somatic structural variations (SVs) across TADs, we utilized 288,457 high-confidence somatic structural variations from 2658 high-coverage whole genome sequencing datasets across various cancer types. We comprehensively profiled structural variations effects on the domain boundaries and the regulation of genes in human cancers. Notably, most of the TAD disruptions do not result in appreciable changes in nearby gene expression where more than 2-fold expression change was observed in only 14% of regions with the boundary deletions. In addition, we demonstrated that SV types affect TADs differently, specifically, complex rearrangements drastically change chromatin folding maps in the cancer genomes.",Homo sapiens,Chromatin Folding Domains Disruptions by Somatic Genomic Rearrangements in Human Cancers

Recent studies suggest that genetic and phenotypic alterations in the BM microenvironment support leukemogenesis and allow leukemic cells to survive and evade chemotherapy-induced death. However, despite substantial evidence indicating the role of tumor-host interactions in AML pathogenesis, little is known about the complex microenvironment of the BM. To address this, we performed novel proteomic profiling of the non-cellular compartment of the BM microenvironment in AML patients (n=10) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=10) using an aptamer-based, highly multiplexed, affinity proteomics platform (SOMAscan). We demonstrate that proteomic assessment of blood or RNA-sequencing of BM are suboptimal alternate screening strategies to determine the true proteomic composition of the extracellular compartment of the AML marrow microenvironment. Proteomic analysis showed 168 proteins significantly differed in abundance, with 91 proteins up-regulated and 77 proteins down-regulated in leukemic BM.

Background: Acral melanoma (AM) is a rare, aggressive type of cutaneous melanoma (CM) with a distinct genetic profile for which comprehensive genome-wide methylation analysis (GWMA) is lacking. We aimed to identify a methylome signature distinguishing primary acral lentiginous melanoma (PALM) from primary non-lentiginous AM involving the acral sites (NALM), metastatic ALM (MALM), primary non-acral CM (PCM), and acral nevus (AN). Methods: A total of 22 PALM, 9 NALM, 10 MALM, 9 PCM, and 3 AN cases were subjected to GWMA using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array interrogating 866,562 CpG sites, and their methylomes were compared. Results: A prominent finding was that the methylation profiles of PALM and NALM were distinct, although both are considered canonical AMs. Four of the genes most differentially methylated between PALM and NALM or PALM and MALM were HHEX, DIPK2A (formerly C3orf58), NELFB (formerly COBRA1), and TEF. However, when primary AMs (PALM+NALM) were compared with MALM, IFITM1 and SIK3 were the most differentially methylated, highlighting their pivotal role in the metastatic potential of AMs. Patients with NALM had significantly worse disease-specific (DSS) and overall survival than patients with PALM. Aberrant methylation was significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathologic parameters, including greater Breslow thickness, ulceration, increased mitotic rate, and lymph node metastasis, and with worse DSS. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes the importance of distinguishing the two epigenetically distinct subtypes of AM. We also identified novel epigenetic prognostic biomarkers that may serve to risk-stratify patients with AM.

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stabilization of the transcription factor NRF2 through genomic alterations in KEAP1 and NFE2L2 occurs in roughly a quarter of patients, often in the context of STK11 tumor suppressor loss. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2 activation in the context of concurrent KRAS mutation and STK11 loss promotes aggressive LUAD tumor behavior in both human and mouse preclinical models. This phenotype is associated with metabolic rewiring and rescue by NRF2 of redox stress, high in STK11 null tumors.

We used a Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism array to characterize the genomic profiles, and subsequently used a statistical application to define them according to clonality within the same individual; the results were confirmed by next generation sequencing of the main CRC-related genes. We categorized the ensuing groups according to colon location, trying to find differential phenotypes with clinical implications. Results: The SCRC Monoclonal group (M) (19 cases) was divided into Monosegmental (MM) and Pancolonic (MP) groups. The MM subgroup consisted of 10 cases (19% of the total), while the MP group contained 9 cases (17%). The SCRC Polyclonal group (P) (33 cases) was also divided into Monosegmental (PM) and Pancolonic (PP) groups: 19 cases were PM (37%), showing preference for location in the left colon (17 cases, 89%), whereas 14 cases were PP (27%). Correlations with clinical features were mainly related to prognosis and familial cancer history.

Finally, the PP group also exhibited a mucin component, with the highest mean-number of tumors (4.6) compared with the mean-number of polyps (7.7), had a poor prognosis and consisted of sporadic cases.

The miRNAs of interest were endogenously expressed in KGN cell-line, gene expression changes were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Potential miRNA-regulated sequences were further filtered from the obtained results by bioinformatic target prediction algorithms and validated for direct miRNA:mRNA binding by luciferase reporter assay.

We herein elucidated the clinical and biological impacts of KDM6A deficiency on human PDAC and identified the therapeutic potential by pathological and molecular evaluation. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of KDM6A was performed in 103 tumor specimens surgically resected from patients with PDAC. Cells knocked out for KDM6A by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and expressing doxycycline-inducible KDM6A were established from each two human PDAC cell lines, respectively. RESULTS: Loss of KDM6A in cancerous tissues was an independent prognostic factor for both recurrence-free and overall survival in the clinical samples. KDM6A knockout enhanced aggressive traits of human PDAC cell lines, whereas KDM6A overexpression suppressed them. Microarray analysis revealed reduced expression of 25 genes including five well-known tumor suppressors, such as CDKN1A, and ChIP-PCR analysis displayed depleted enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter regions of the five candidates. The epigenetic alterations were induced by the impaired recruitment of a histone acetyltransferase p300, which cooperatively interacted with KDM6A. Consistent with these results, the KDM6A knockout cells demonstrated higher vulnerability to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors through the reactivation of CDKN1A in vitro and in vivo than the KDM6A wild-type. CONCLUSIONS: KDM6A exhibited essential roles in human PDAC as a tumor suppressor.

Tobacco smoke exposure science has created a body of knowledge that demonstrates the conclusive negative impacts on respiratory health; similar knowledge remains to be established for cannabis. To address this unmet need, we performed in vitro functional and transcriptomic experiments with a human airway epithelial cell line (Calu-3) exposed to cannabis smoke, with tobacco smoke as a positive control. Results: We demonstrate that cannabis smoke induced functional and transcriptional responses that overlapped with tobacco smoke. Ontology and pathway analysis revealed that cannabis smoke induced DNA replication and oxidative stress responses. Functionally, cannabis smoke impaired epithelial cell barrier function, antiviral responses, and increased inflammatory mediator production. Our study reveals striking similarities between cannabis and tobacco smoke exposure on impairing barrier function, suppressing antiviral pathways, potentiating of pro-inflammatory mediators, and inducing oncogenic and oxidative stress gene expression signatures. LABA/GC intervention in airway epithelial cells exposed to cannabis smoke reduces levels of pro-inflammatory (CXCL8) and antiviral (CXCL10) mediators, while transcriptomic signatures of neutrophil mediated immunity and oxidative stress remain elevated. Conclusions: Collectively our data suggest that cannabis smoke exposure is not innocuous and may possess many of the deleterious properties of tobacco smoke, warranting additional studies to support public policy, government regulations, and user practices.",Homo sapiens,Transcriptomic and barrier responses of human airway epithelial cells exposed to cannabis smoke with and without LABA/GC intervention

Ectopic expression or activation of EGFR is found in most TNBCs, and EGFR inhibitors can suppress TNBC growth in vitro. However, these agents exhibit limited efficacy in TNBC patients, possibly due to the nonkinase oncogenic functions of EGFR and the compensatory effects of other oncogenic activities following anti-EGFR therapy. Here, we identified a positive correlation between EGFR and FGD5 expression in TNBC samples. FGD5 deletion attenuated TNBC initiation and progression by decreasing EGFR stability and expression. Moreover, the proteins involved in mutual compensation of EGFR signaling were significantly downregulated in FGD5-deleted TNBC cells. Mechanistically, FGD5 interacted with EGFR to maintain EGFR stability by impeding EGFR ubiquitylation and degradation mediated by the E3 ligase ITCH; disrupting the FGD5-EGFR interaction accelerated EGFR degradation and produced robust anti-TNBC activity.

Recently, two Cas9 variants with a relaxed PAM requirement (NG) have been developed (xCas9 and Cas9-NG) but their activity has been measured at only a small number of endogenous sites. Here we devised a high-throughput Cas9 pooled competition screen to compare the performance of both PAM-flexible Cas9 variants and wild-type Cas9 at thousands of genomic loci and across 3 modalities (gene knock-out, transcriptional activation and suppression). We show that PAM flexibility comes at a substantial cost of decreased DNA targeting and cutting.

Therefore, mechanical properties of individual patient cells can contribute essential knowledge in cancer diagnostics and in precision therapies. However, clinical applications are limited by lack of current knowledge and of reliable and robust cell mechanical tests. In a comprehensive study, we found a Triangular Correlation (TrC) between cell deformability, phagocytic like capacity, and cancer aggressiveness. A significant application of the TrC is that phagocytic measurements can be a surrogate marker for detecting malignancy of cancer cells based on mechanical properties. We found that the uptake of inert sub-micron and micro-beads was massively higher in cancer cells compared with non-cancerous cells. Moreover, cells with a higher malignancy potential had greater uptake capacity. Importantly, in a reciprocal approach, we sorted either human bladder cancer cells or melanoma cells into subpopulations, solely based on their phagocytic capacity. The more phagocytic subpopulations showed elevated phenotypes of cancer aggressiveness ex vivo and in vivo. The uptake potential was found to be an imprinted feature preserved genetically and enriched over the sorting cycles. A gene expression profile revealed differences in gene sets associated with regulation of cell-cell and extracellular matrix adhesions and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing showed that differences in gene expression were reflected also at the chromatin level. Importantly, in all cases studied here, enhanced phagocytic ability and elevated aggressiveness phenotypes were correlated with greater cell deformability, providing the mechanical link of the TrC. A computational model supported the notion that the uptake capacity can be a marker for malignancy mediated by cell mechanics.

Methods: Primary leiomyoma cells were isolated from fresh uterine leiomyoma tissues and transfected with PLIN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA; 100 nM, #4392422) or non-targeting siRNA (100 nM, #4390844; Ambion, Foster City, CA) for 72 hours. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit and RNA-seq library was completed per the manufacturer’s instructions using the KAPA Stranded RNA-seq Kit with RiboErase (#KK8483; KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). cDNA libraries were sequenced as single-end, 75 base-length reads on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with an average read count of 27 million reads per sample. The quality of DNA reads, in fastq format, was evaluated using FastQC. Adapters were trimmed, and reads of poor quality or aligning to rRNA sequences were filtered. The cleaned reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens genome (hg19) using STAR. Read counts for each gene were calculated using htseq-count in conjunction with a gene annotation file for hg19 obtained from University of California Santa Cruz (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Results: A total of 3877 genes were found to be differentially expressed, with 2557 genes found to be upregulated and 1320 genes found to be downregulated by PLIN2 knockdown.

Using a suite of human haploid genetic screens, we identify the SREBP Regulating Gene (SPRING; C12ORF49) as a novel regulator of this pathway. SPRING is a glycosylated Golgi-resident membrane protein. Genetic ablation of SPRING in human Hap1 cells, murine Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells, and in primary murine hepatocytes leads to a marked reduction in SREBP signaling. In mice, deletion of Spring results in embryonic lethality. However, we show that adenoviral-mediated silencing of hepatic Spring expression also attenuates the SREBP response. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that attenuated SREBP signaling in SPRINGKO cells is a result of reduced SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and its mislocalization. Whereas in control cells SCAP cycles between the ER and the Golgi in a sterol-dependent manner, in SPRINGKO cells SCAP is trapped in the Golgi irrespective of the cellular sterol status. Consistent with limited functional SCAP in SPRINGKO cells, reintroducing SCAP restores SREBP-dependent signaling, cholesterol biosynthesis, and lipoprotein uptake. Consistent with SREBP signaling being required for cell growth and proliferation, a wide range of human tumor cell lines display dependency on SPRING expression. In conclusion, we identify SPRING as a previously unrecognized determinant of the SREBP pathway that is essential for proper SCAP function.",Homo sapiens,A suite of haploid genetic screens identifies SPRING as a novel determinant of SREBP signaling and cholesterol metabolism

Methods: We established the ARID2 knockout HCC cell lines by using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and investigated the gene expression profiles and biological functions. Results: Bioinformatic analysis indicated that UV-response genes were negatively regulated in the ARID2-KO cells, and they were certainly sensitized to UV irradiation. ARID2 depletion attenuated nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA damage sites introduced by exposure to UV as well as chemical compounds known as carcinogens for HCC, benzo[a]pyrene and FeCl3, since XPG could not be accumulated without ARID2. By using large-scale public data sets, we validated that ARID2 knockout could lead to similar molecular changes between in vitro and in vivo, and moreover observed a higher number of somatic mutations in the ARID2-mutated subtypes than that in the ARID2 wild-type across various types of cancers including HCC. Conclusions: We provided evidence that ARID2 knockout could contribute to disruption of NER process through inhibiting the recruitment of XPG, resulting in susceptibility to carcinogens and potential hypermutation.

APA leading to 3' UTR shortening (3'-US) of mRNAs is a common feature of most cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting APA in cancer are not well established. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism promoting 3'-US in cancer through ubiquitination and degradation of the 3' processing complex protein, PCF11, by the cancer-specific MAGE-A11-HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A11 is normally expressed only in the male germline but is frequently re-activated in human cancers. MAGE-A11 is necessary for cancer cell viability and is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. Screening for targets of MAGE-A11 revealed that it ubiquitinates PCF11 for degradation. This leads to APA of many transcripts in ovarian and lung tumors from both mouse xenografts and human tumor specimens. Importantly, expression of a non-degradable PCF11 degron mutant suppressed MAGE-A11 oncogenic activity and 3'-US. Analysis of the transcripts affected by MAGE-A11, revealed core oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes and pathways. This includes 3'-US of the cyclin D2 oncogene leading to deregulation of the Rb tumor suppressor pathway. Furthermore, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) partners of 3'-US transcripts include many tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN that is downregulated by MAGE-A11 resulting in activation of the Akt growth signaling pathway. These findings provide insights into the function of MAGE-A11 and help explain the molecular mechanisms driving APA in cancer.",Homo sapiens,A cancer-specific ubiquitin ligase drives alternative polyadenylation by targeting PCF11

Thus, HOXC4 and HOXC6 are clinically relevant biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these HOXC genes contribute to prostate cancer is not yet understood. To begin to address the role of HOXC4 and HOXC6 in prostate cancer, we performed RNA-seq analyses before and after siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOXC4 and/or HOXC6 and also performed ChIP-seq to identify genomic binding sites for both of these transcription factors. Our studies demonstrate that HOXC4 and HOXC6 co-localize with HOXB13, FOXA1 and AR, three transcription factors previously shown to contribute to the development of prostate cancer.

Previous studies on liver cancer have reported a superior prognosis for inflamed tumors compared to non-inflamed tumors. However, liver cancer is highly heterogeneous immunologically and genetically, and a finer classification of the liver cancer microenvironment may improve our understanding of its immunological diversity and response to immune therapy. Methods: We characterized the immune gene signatures of 234 primary liver cancers, mainly virus-related, from a Japanese population using RNA-Seq of tumors and matched non-tumorous hepatitis livers. We then compared them with the somatic alterations detected using the whole-genome sequencing. Findings: Liver cancers expressed lower levels of immune marker genes than non-tumorous hepatitis livers, indicating immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Several immunosuppression mechanisms functioned actively and mutually exclusively, resulting in four immune subclasses of liver cancer: tumor-associated macrophage (TAM), CTNNB1, cytolytic activity (CYT), and regulatory T cell (Treg). The CYT and Treg subclasses represented inflamed tumors, while the TAM and CTNNB1 subclasses represented non-inflamed tumors. The TAM subclass, which comprised 31% of liver cancers, showed a poor survival, expressed elevated levels of extracellular matrix genes, and was associated with somatic mutations of chromatin regulator ARID2. The results of cell line experiments suggested a functional link between ARID2 and chemokine production by liver cancer cells.

We have evaluated the growth inhibitory effect of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) across a broad spectrum of patient samples, using a panel of 40 human glioblastoma initiating cell (GIC) cultures. A wide range of responsiveness was observed. BMP4 response was positively correlated with a proneural mRNA expression profile, high SOX2 activity, and BMP4-dependent upregulation of genes associated with inhibition of the MAPK pathway, as demonstrated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). BMP4 response in sensitive cells was mediated by the canonical BMP receptor pathway involving SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and SMAD4 expression. SOX2 was consistently down regulated in BMP4-treated cells. Forced expression of SOX2 attenuated the BMP4 response including a reduced upregulation om MAPK inhibitory genes, implying a functional relationship between SOX2 down regulation and responsiveness.

We therefore employ leptomeningeal derivatives of human breast and lung cancer cell lines that reproduce both floating and adherent phenotypes of human LM in vivo and in vitro. We introduce a trypsin/EDTA-based fractionation method to reliably separate the two cell subsets and demonstrate that in vitro cultured floating cells have decreased proliferation rate, lower ATP content, and are enriched in distinct metabolic signatures. Long-term fractionation and transcriptomic analysis suggest a high degree plasticity between the two phenotypes in vitro. Floating cells colonize mouse leptomeninges more rapidly and associate with shortened survival.

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) is overexpressed in 70% of diagnosed BCa patients and androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed in 80-90% of diagnosed PCa patients. Thus, BCa and PCa patients are given therapy that reduces hormone levels or directly blocks HR activity; but most patients eventually develop treatment resistance. 15-30% of BCa patients and ≥ 30% of PCa patients that acquire treatment resistance develop tumors enriched in cancer cells with low or no HR accumulation. Furthermore, 15-20% of BCa patients and 10-20% of PCa patients are intrinsically HR-negative (HR-), and thus, have intrinsic resistance to therapy. We have previously reported that interleukin-1 (IL-1) inflammatory cytokine downregulates ERa and AR mRNA in HR-positive (HR+) BCa and PCa cell lines. Additionally, we had identified pro-survival proteins and processes upregulated by IL-1 in HR+ BCa and PCa cells, that are basally high in HR- BCa and PCa cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that IL-1 confers a conserved gene expression pattern in HR+ BCa and PCa cells that mimics conserved basal gene expression patterns in HR- BCa and PCa cells, to promote HR-independent survival and tumorigenicity. Methods: To identify changes in global gene expression we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for HR+ BCa and PCa cell lines exposed to IL-1 and for untreated HR- BCa and PCa cell lines. We confirmed expression patterns of select genes by RT-qPCR and used siRNA and/or drug inhibition to silence select genes in BCa and PCa cell lines. We also compared our gene expression data with publicly available data sets from hormone receptor-independent sublines. Finally, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify signaling pathways encode by our RNA-seq data set. Results: We identified 350 genes in common between BCa and PCa cells that are induced or repressed by IL-1 in HR+ cells that are, respectively, basally high or low in HR- cells. Among these genes, we identified Sequestome-1 (SQSTM1/p62) and SRY (Sex-Determining Region Y)-Box 9 (SOX9) to be essential for survival of HR- BCa and PCa cell lines. Analysis of publicly available data indicates that p62 and SOX9 expression are elevated in hormone receptor-independent BCa and PCa sublines generated in vitro, suggesting that p62 and SOX9 have a role in acquired treatment resistance. We also assessed HR- cell line viability in response verteporfin, an FDA approved therapy for macular degeneration known to target p62, and we found that verteporfin is cytotoxic for HR- cells lines. Conclusions: Taken together, our 350 gene set can be used to identify novel therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers conserved among acquired (e.g. due to inflammation) or intrinsic hormone receptor-independent BCa and PCa.",Homo sapiens,IL-1-conferred gene expression pattern in ERa+ BCa and AR+ PCa cells is intrinsic to ERa- BCa and AR- PCa cells and promotes cell survival

Dynamic changes in glucose metabolism were measured real-time by an Extracellular flux analyzer. As expected, the cell lines exhibited different levels of Met and responded differently to HGF stimulation. As confirmed by RNA sequencing, the level of Met expression is associated with the number of upregulated HGF-dependent genes. Overall, Met stimulation by HGF leads to increased glycolysis, presumably mediated by higher expression of three key enzymes of glycolysis.

Here we focused on investigating PRMT4 (also called coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1, CARM1) due to its high expression and the associated poor prognosis in ERa-positive breast cancers. We first uncovered the chromatin-binding landscape and transcriptional targets of CARM1 in the presence of estrogen in ERa-positive breast cancer cells employing genomic and transcriptomics approaches. CARM1 was found to be predominantly and specifically recruited to ERa-bound active enhancers and essential for the transcriptional activation of cognate estrogen-induced gene transcriptional activation in response to estrogen. Global mapping of CARM1 substrates revealed that CARM1 methylates a large cohort of proteins with diverse biological functions, including regulation of intracellular estrogen receptor signaling, chromatin organization, chromatin remodeling and others. Intriguingly, a number of proteins were hypermethylated exclusively by CARM1 on a cluster of arginine residues. Exemplified by MED12, hypermethylation of these proteins by CARM1 served as a molecular beacon for recruiting coactivator protein, tudor domain-containing 3 (TDRD3), to ensure the full activation of estrogen/ERa target genes. In consistent with its critical role in estrogen-induced gene transcriptional activation, CARM1 was found to promote cell proliferation of ERa-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in mice.

The current study examined transcriptome-wide changes following inhibition of cytoplasmic cap methylation.

Cap end mapping of several TOP mRNAs identified recapping events at native 5’ ends and downstream of the TOP sequence of EIF3K and EIF3D.

Results: We analyzed DNA methylation data from IDH1/2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, breast carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and cholangiocarcinoma. We show that only a small fraction of differentially methylated probes is disease specific and that hypermethylation affects predominantly gene bodies and enhancers while gene promoters in IDH1/2 mutant cancers remain profoundly unmethylated. Commonly hypomethylated enhancers were associated with tissue differentiation and cell fate determination. We also show that some chromosomes and chromosomal regions are more affected by IDH mutation. In particular we show that regions of dense heterochromatin on several chromosomes do not appear to be affected by IDH mutation induced hypermethylation. Conclusions: We show that there are gene region and chromosome specific areas that are preferentially affected or spared by changes in DNA methylation across IDH mutant cancers. This suggests that while IDH mutation causes the same biochemical change in all cancers, the effect may vary in tissue specific fashion.

Elevated expression of CUL4B was confirmed in colon tumors and was associated with poor overall survival. Inhibition of CUL4B in cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor organoids led to reduced sphere formation, proliferation and metastasis capacity.

However, drug resistance to sorafenib may often occur over time and cause further tumor aggression. Recently, cancer stem cells were found in HCC and were speculated to be involved in tumor progression. SOX9 is highly expressed in HCC cancer stem cells and promotes cell proliferation and self-renewal. Meanwhile, HCC patients with higher SOX9 expression show poorer prognosis [1]. Whether SOX9 is involved in sorafenib resistance in HCC is still unclear. Here, we found that sorafenib treatment increased SOX9 expression in HCC cell lines. Overexpression of exogenous SOX9 in HCC increased sorafenib resistance both in vitro and in vivo, whereas down-regulation led to inhibition of sorafenib resistance. Knock-down of SOX9 by RNA interference caused down-regulation of downstream genes, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). The drug resistance to sorafenib caused by SOX9 overexpression could be ameliorated by overexpression of SOX9 in combination withby ABCG2 inhibition in HCC cell lines. In the cohort of patients resistant to sorafenib, we found that patients with lower SOX9 expression had more prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Cox analysis shows that SOX9 expression exerts as an independent risk factor for HCC, and logistic regression analysis reveals that SOX9 expression, tumor capsule deficiency, tumor diameters, and microvascular invasion are risk factors for poor prognosis of HCC patients.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that can cause lymphomas, epithelial cancers, and other diseases, most of which require the lytic cycle. While the lytic cycle of EBV can be triggered by chemicals and immunologic ligands, the lytic cascade is only activated when expression of the EBV latency-to-lytic switch protein ZEBRA is turned on. ZEBRA then transcriptionally activates other EBV genes and together with some of those gene products ensures completion of the lytic cycle. However, not every latently-infected cell exposed to a lytic trigger turns expression of ZEBRA on, resulting in responsive and refractory subpopulations. What governs this dichotomy? By examining the nascent transcriptome following exposure to a lytic trigger, we find that several cellular genes are transcriptionally upregulated temporally upstream of ZEBRA. These genes regulate lytic susceptibility to variable degrees in latently-infected cells that respond to mechanistically distinct lytic triggers. While increased expression of these cellular genes defines a pro-lytic state, such upregulation also runs counter to the well-known mechanism of viral nuclease-mediated host shut-off that is activated downstream of ZEBRA. Furthermore, a subset of upregulated cellular genes is transcriptionally repressed downstream of ZEBRA, indicating an additional mode of virus-mediated host shut-off through transcriptional repression. Thus, increased transcription of a set of host genes contributes to a pro-lytic state that allows a subpopulation of cells to support the EBV lytic cycle.",Homo sapiens,Nascent transcriptomics reveal cellular pro-lytic factors upregulated upstream of the latency-to-lytic switch protein of Epstein-Barr virus

Mechanically, we find that lncMX1-215 directly interacted with GCN5, a known H3K27 acetylase to interrupt its binding to H3K27 acetylation. Clinically, negative correlations between lncMX1-215 and PD-L1, galectin-9 were observed. Finally, overexpression of lncMX1-215 suppressed the proliferation and metastasis capacity in vitro and in vivo in HNSCC. Our results suggest that lncMX1-215 negatively regulates immunosuppression through interrupting GCN5/H3K27ac in HNSCC and provides novel insights into immune checkpoint blockade treatment.",Homo sapiens,"A novel IFNα-induced long noncoding RNA, lncMX1-215, negatively regulates immunosuppression by interrupting H3K27 acetylation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma"

However, detecting these cells specifically and targeting them therapeutically remain challenging. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key players in cancer biology, we set up to identify miRNAs involved in chemoresistance of breast cancer stem cells. In this study, we enriched populations of chemoresistant cancer stem cells from breast cancer and non-transformed breast cell lines using mammospheres. These mammospheres were treated or not with two chemoreagents, and we profiled surviving cells using miRNA microarray analysis. Comparison of the profiles from treated and untreated mammospheres as well as control and cancer cells yielded a six-miRNAs signature specific for chemoresistant stem cell-enriched subpopulations. From this signature miR-363-3p was found to be most highly overexpressed in various breast cancer cell lines and derived cancer stem cell-enriched populations, whereas non-tumorigenic cells had low levels. Inhibition of miR-363-3p was found to decrease cancer stem cell maintenance and tumorigenicity in vitro. Consistently, miR-363-3p downregulation decreased tumor growth and metastatization by human tumor cells transplanted in mice. Finally, miR363-3p levels in the sera of 38 breast cancer patients enrolled in a neoadjuvant trial correlated well with the response to the chemotherapeutic treatments. Altogether, miR363-3p was identified as a mediator of the breast cancer stem cell phenotype, and it may provide a predictor of the response to chemotherapy from a simple blood test, as well as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer stem cell targeting.

Fibroblasts are the principal mediator of fibroproliferative disorders. To reveal dynamic epigenetic and transcriptome changes of keloid fibroblasts, a vertical study from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses followed by in vivo confirmation of candidate molecule expression and subsequent functional testing was carried out using an early passage, freshly isolated keloid fibroblast cell strain and its paired normal control. These keloid fibroblasts produce keloid-like scars in a plasma clot-based skin equivalent humanized keloid animal model. RNA-seq analysis reveals that Hepatic fibrosis is the most significant pathway followed by Wnt–b-catenin signaling, TGF-b signaling, regulation of the EMT pathway, the STAT3 pathway, and adherens junction signaling. ATAC-seq analysis shows that STAT3 signaling is the most active pathway in keloid fibroblasts, followed by Wnt signaling (Wnt5) and regulation of the EMT pathway. Immunohistochemistry confirms that activated STAT3, (Tyr705 phospho-STAT3) and/or b-catenin are upregulated in dermal fibroblasts of keloid clinical specimens and mature keloid skin equivalent implants from the humanized mouse model compared to the normal control. The effect of STAT3 signaling on keloid fibroblast collagen expression was further tested in plasma clot-based skin equivalents using Cucurbitacin I, a selective JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor.

Furthermore, a comparison of ATAC-seq profiles of ASCP and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) genomes using flow sorted PDX models distinguished genes with accessible chromatin in ASCP genomes including the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2, the pancreatic cancer stem cell driver RORγ, and a FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion associated with focal CNVs in both genes. Organoids derived from these models were used to screen compounds of interest.

Current biomarkers used in breast cancer treatment are highly dependent on targeting ER, PR, or HER2 in clinical practice, which results in ttreatment failure and disease recurrence continue to be clinically challenging. In this regards, there is still a crucial need for improvement of TNBC treatment by discovery of effective biomarkers that can be easily translated to the clinics and possible targets as prognosis and novel therapies. This study reports an approach for biomarker discovery, which predicts tumour relapse and pathologic complete response (pCR) in TNBC on the basis of mRNA expression quantified using NanoString nCounter Immunology Panel. We identify nine and 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, that are strongly associated with pCR and relapse from 579 immune genes over a small number of samples (n=55) using edgeR. To overcome a small sample size limitation, prediction models based on the random forest are constructed on the DEGs as selected features extracted from the DEG analysis. Comprehensive analysis indicated that our prediction models outperform those constructed on features extracted from the existing feature selection model such as, Elastic Net in terms of accuracy. The prediction models are assessed by randomization test to validate the robustness (empirical P for the model of pCR= 0.022 and empirical P for the model of relapse= 0.025). Furthermore, three DEGs (IL17B, EDNRB, and TGFBI) in the model of relapse show prognostic significance to predict cancer patient survival through Cox proportional hazards regression model based survival analysis.",Homo sapiens,Prediction of prognostic signatures in triple-negative breast cancer based on the differential expression analysis via NanoString nCounter immune panel

OCCC is chemo-resistant and has the worst stage-adjusted prognosis amongst EOC. Yet, treatment for OCCC patients is no different than other EOC. As OCCC incidence rate has significantly increase in recent decades, it is critical to find OCCC-tailored therapeutic. However, majority of EOC gene expression molecular subtypes (GEMS) studies for personalized medicine focused on the high grade serous histology, and studies in OCCC GEMS were of small sample size. Using more than 200 OCCC gene expression profiles, we identified two OCCC subtypes: EpiCC—epithelial-like, early stage, good prognosis, relative higher rate of gene mutations in SWI/SNF complex; and MesCC—mesenchymal-like, late stage, and poor prognosis. The differential prognosis between EpiCC and MesCC could be observed as early as stage IC. Genetic, copy number and transcriptome profiling showed that both EpiCC and MesCC carried OCCC-associated aberrations. The EpiCC and MesCC are reproducible in validation cohorts and OCCC cell lines. Cell lines assays showed that MesCC is more proliferative and more anoikis resistant than EpiCC. Both EpiCC and MesCC are resistant to cisplatin. Applying the OCCC subtypes to TCGA 534 renal clear cell carcinoma indicated interoperability of the subtyping scheme, and revealed preferential response of EpiCC to sorafenib, and MesCC to bevacizumab.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of Cyclin K in lung cancer radioresistance. Methods: Expression levels of Cyclin K were measured by immunohistochemistry in human lung cancer tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues. Cell growth and proliferation, neutral comet and foci formation assays, G2/M checkpoint and a xenograft mouse model were used for functional analyses. Gene expression was examined by RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. Protein-protein interaction was assessed by immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Results: We report that Cyclin K is frequently overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Functionally, we demonstrate that Cyclin K depletion results in reduced proliferation, defective G2/M checkpoint and enhanced radiosensitivity in lung cancer. Mechanistically, we reveal that Cyclin K interacts with and promotes the stabilization of β-catenin, thereby upregulating the expression of Cyclin D1. More importantly, we show that Cyclin D1 is the major effector that mediates the biological functions of Cyclin K in lung cancer. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Cyclin K positively modulates the β-catenin/Cyclin D1 axis to promote tumorigenesis and radioresistance in lung cancer, indicating that Cyclin K may represent a novel attractive biomarker for lung cancer radiotherapy.",Homo sapiens,Cyclin K interacts with β-catenin to induce Cyclin D1 expression and facilitate tumorigenesis and radioresistance in lung cancer

By entering G0, cancer cells survive unfavorable conditions such as chemotherapy and cause relapse. While G0 cells have been studied at the transcriptome level, how post-transcriptional regulation contributes to their chemoresistance remains unknown. We induced chemoresistant and quiescent (G0) leukemic cells by serum-starvation or chemotherapy treatment. To study post-transcriptional regulation in G0 leukemic cells, we systematically analyzed their transcriptome, translatome, and proteome. We find that our resistant G0 cells recapitulate gene expression profiles of in vivo chemoresistant leukemic and G0 models. In G0 cells, canonical translation initiation is inhibited; yet we find that inflammatory genes are highly translated, indicating alternative post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, AU-rich elements (AREs) are significantly enriched in the up-regulated G0 translatome and transcriptome. Mechanistically, we find the stress-responsive p38 MAPK-MK2 signaling pathway stabilizes ARE mRNAs by phosphorylation and inactivation of mRNA decay factor, tristetraprolin (TTP) in G0. This permits expression of ARE mRNAs that promote chemoresistance. Conversely, inhibition of TTP phosphorylation by p38 MAPK inhibitors and non-phosphorylatable TTP mutant decreases ARE-bearing TNFα and DUSP1 mRNAs and sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, co-inhibiting p38 MAPK and TNFα—prior to or along with chemotherapy—substantially reduced chemoresistance in primary leukemic cells ex vivo and in vivo. These studies uncover post-transcriptional regulation underlying chemoresistance in leukemia. Our data reveal the p38 MAPK-MK2-TTP axis as a key regulator of expression of ARE bearing mRNAs that promote chemoresistance.

KU binds to DNA ends, initiates cNHEJ, and recruits and activates DNA-PKcs. Beyond DNA, KU also binds to RNA, with unknown significance in mammals. Using mouse models, we uncovered an unexpected role for DNA-PK in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and hematopoiesis. Expression of kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcsKD/KD) abroagates cNHEJ2. But DNA-PKcsKD/KDTp53-/- mice develop myeloid disease rather than pro-B cell lymphoma, like other cNHEJ/Tp53-deficient mice3. DNA-PKcs is its own the best substrate. Blocking DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the T2609, but not the S2056 cluster leads to KU-dependent 18S rRNA processing defects, compromises global protein synthesis in hematopoietic cells and causes bone marrow failure in mice.

The activity of its catalytic core, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), is controlled by Cyclin C and MED12, with its deregulation contributing to numerous malignancies. Here, we combine in vitro biochemistry, crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry and in vivo studies to describe the binding location of the N-terminal segment of MED12 on the CDK8/Cyclin C complex and to gain mechanistic insights into the activation of CDK8 by MED12. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal portion of MED12 wraps around CDK8, whereby it positions an ""activation helix"" close to the T-loop of CDK8 for its activation. Intriguingly, mutations in the activation helix that are frequently found in cancers do not diminish the affinity of MED12 for CDK8, yet likely alter the exact positioning of the activation helix. Furthermore, we find the transcriptome-wide gene expression changes in human cells that result from a mutation in the MED12 activation helix to correlate with deregulated genes in breast and colon cancer. Last, functional assays in presence of kinase inhibitors reveal that binding of MED12 remodels the active site of CDK8 and thereby precludes the inhibition of ternary CDK8 complexes by type-II kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our results not only allow us to propose a revised model of how CDK8 activity is regulated by MED12, but they also offer a path forward in developing small molecules that target CDK8 in its MED12-bound form.",Homo sapiens,A precisely positioned MED12 activation helix stimulates CDK8 kinase activity

ER-mediated gene regulation requires proper chromatin-conformation to facilitate interactions between ER-bound enhancers and their target promoters. A major determinant of chromatin structure is the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), that dimerizes and together with cohesin stabilizes chromatin loops and forms the boundaries of topologically associated domains. However, whether CTCF-binding elements (CBEs) are essential for ER-driven cell proliferation is unknown. To address this question in a global manner, we implemented a CRISPR-based functional genetic screening approach targeting CBEs located in the vicinity of ERα-bound enhancers. We identified four functional CBEs and demonstrated the role of one in inducing chromatin conformation changes in favor of activation of PREX1, a key ERα target gene in breast cancer. Indeed, high PREX1 expression is a bona-fide marker of ER-dependency in cell lines, and associated with good outcome after anti-hormonal treatment.

Recently, hotspot mutations in ENL were frequently found in Wilms’ tumor, the most common type of pediatric kidney cancer. Here, we report that these cancer-associated mutations in the ENL YEATS domain confer gain of functions in transcriptional control and impair kidney differentiation by driving self-reinforced chromatin targeting. Ectopic expression of ENL mutants in kidney cell lines resulted in transcriptional changes of genes enriched in embryonic nephron progenitors and Wilms’ tumor. When tested in a nephrogenesis assay, ENL mutant expression led to undifferentiated structures resembling those observed in human Wilms’ tumor. Genome-wide analyses revealed that while mutant ENL bound to largely similar genomic loci as wild-type ENL, they exhibited increased occupancy at a subset of targets, including developmentally critical genes such as the HOXA cluster. The cancer-associated mutations enabled self-reinforced recruitment of ENL on chromatin by promoting self-association, resulting in the formation of discrete nuclear puncta that are characteristic of phase-separated biomolecular condensates. Enhanced occupancy of ENL mutants led to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of transcription elongation machinery that enforces active transcription from target loci­­­­.

We identify that a fusion of the catalytic domain of TET1 to dCas9 targeted to the CDKL5 promoter using three guide RNAs causes significant reactivation of the inactive allele in combination with removal of methyl groups from CpG dinucleotides. Strikingly, we demonstrate that co-expression of TET1 and a VP64 transactivator have a synergistic effect on the reactivation of the inactive allele to levels above 60% of the active allele. We further used a multi-omics assessment to determine potential off-targets on the transcriptome and methylome. We find that synergistic delivery of dCas9 effectors is highly selective for the target site.

Extensive genetic intratumoral heterogeneity and diverse clinical outcomes pose therapeutic challenges in treating children affected by this aggressive disease. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma, including a possible origin from multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Utilizing an in vivo mouse genetics approach, we demonstrate that lineage-restricted sympathoadrenal (SA) progenitors and not NCSCs are the cellular origin of neuroblastoma. Human neuroblastoma tissue is composed of two spatially juxtaposed cell types, neuroblasts and Schwann cells, both cell types derive from neural crest (NC) lineage. This composition mimics the architecture of sympathetic ganglions (SG) as well as of adrenal medulla at the late stage of neural crest (NC)  development. Similarly to SG, SOX10 is restricted to Schwannian cells and is not present in tumorigenic neuroblasts. Transcriptional landscape of Sox genes can serve as paradigmatic model for stage identification along NC lineage development. While early multipotent NCSCs are characterized by the expression of Sox9/Sox10 transcription factors (TF), committed SA progenitor identity is defined by the presence of Sox4/Sox11 TFs. Molecularly, we show that the core transcriptional network that orchestrate neuroblastoma maintenance is highly reminiscent of the SA progenitors.

This study aims at investigating the roles of anillin in regulating breast cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to deplete anillin in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231and BT549 cells and to overexpress it in poorly invasive MCF10AneoT cells.

In breast cancer cells, anillin was localized in the nucleus, however anillin knockout affected the cytoplasmic/cortical events such as the organization of actin cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesions. This was accompanied by a global transcriptional reprogramming of anillin-depleted breast cancer cells that resulted in suppression of their stemness and induction of the mesenchymal to epithelial trans-differentiation. Such trans-differentiation was manifested by upregulation of basal keratins along with increased expression of E-cadherin and P-cadherin.

It is now widely recognized that this cancer emerges as metastasis from the fallopian tube and the lack of suitable in vitro disease models poses a major obstacle for efforts to improve our understanding of this deadly disease. We used organoids of healthy human FT epithelium as a model for stepwise genetic modification towards malignancy, using shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of three major HGSOC driver genes: p53, PTEN and Retinoblastoma (Rb). These pathways are known to be disrupted in the vast majority of HGSOC patients (>95%, 45% and 67% of cases, respectively as reported by TCGA consortium). Unexpectedly, combined loss of function of the three tumor suppressor proteins, p53, PTEN and Rb, led to a growth arrest and loss of stemness if organoids are cultured in medium optimized for healthy FT epithelium, which maintains high Wnt signaling and BMP pathway inhibition. This designates a requirement for alterations in the exogenous signaling cues to facilitate transformation. Indeed, we show that successful expansion of patient-derived HGSOC organoids from solid tumor deposits depends on the absence of exogenous Wnt3A in the medium. Using a combinatorial screening approach of different medium compositions, we have established 15 organoid lines, which closely resemble the parental tumor tissue and express hallmarks of HGSOC phenotype as revealed by histology and global gene expression profiles. Strikingly, the medium optimized for ovarian cancer organoids also rescued the growth of the modified organoid lines, showing that changes within the niche environment are required to promote stemness upon depletion of p53/PTEN/RB. Likewise, surface expression of the stemness marker CD133 was strongly increased in triple KD organoids in the absence of Wnt3A/Rspo1. Complementary to this finding, the addition of Wnt agonists to cancer organoids led to rapid growth arrest and a sharp drop in stemness, as evidenced by cell viability assay and the number of CD133 positive cells, respectively. Taken together, our data reveal that critical changes in the paracrine environment constitute early events during HGSOC development.",Homo sapiens,Preservation of stemness in high-grade serous ovarian cancer organoids requires low Wnt environment

The activation of promoters within high copy number TE families can thereby massively remodel the transcriptional and epigenetic state of cancer cells. This effect is accelerated following epigenetic therapy. However, whether TE de-repression is purely stochastic or co-regulated with genic transcriptional programs is poorly understood. Using single cell 5’ RNA-sequencing, we characterize over ten-fold variation in global TE expression per single cancer cell following epigenetic therapy . We uncover combinatorial TE expression patterns across thousands of transcribed TE loci from hundreds of conserved families. These signatures are associated with distinct cell cycle stages, stress responses and additional gene regulatory processes. We finally exemplify how sequence composition and epigenomic context cooperate to shape the dynamic transcriptional landscape of large TE families.. Single cell RNA-sequencing thereby implicates thousands of potent promoters within TEs as an underestimated source of regulatory heterogeneity in cancer.",Homo sapiens,Single cell analysis reveals dynamics of transposable element expression following epigenetic de-repression

We reveal that the MLLC180 subunit alone can colocalize with miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) components in cytoplasm processing bodies (P-bodies), where miRNA-mediated gene silencing takes place. In addition, we show that MLL was specifically required for miRNA-mediated translational repression, but not for miRNA or siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage. Mechanistically, MLL was necessarily required for recruiting miRNA to the miRISC and P-body core, partly through its binding partner RAN. Furthermore, dysregulation of the miRNA repression function in MLL leukemic cells was essential for high-level expression of MYC, which ensured the survival of MLL leukemic cells. Thus, our investigation discovered that the MLL subunit alone can exert other functions in miRNA-mediated gene silencing apart from the epigenetic function of the whole MLL heterodimer.
