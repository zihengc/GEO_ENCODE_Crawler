Dysregulated mTOR signalling has been shown in cancer, COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). mTOR forms the catalytic subunit of 2 protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 which differ in upstream inputs, downstream effects and sensitivity to the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin. Aim: To compare the effects of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin with an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTORC1/2, AZD8055, on TGFβ1 induced transcriptional responses during myofibroblast differentiation by RNA-Seq analysis. Methods: Primary human lung fibroblasts were treated with TGFβ1 for 24h to induce myofibroblast differentiation and extra cellular matrix (ECM) production in the presence of rapamycin or AZD8055. Fibroblasts were also treated with rapamycin or AZD8055 without TGFβ1. Total mRNA was analysed by RNA-Seq. Results: On a global transcriptomic level, TGFβ1 significantly affected the expression of ~4,200 genes by more than 1.5 fold, of which ~1,100 changes were reversed by pan-mTORC1/2 inhibition, while being insensitive to rapamycin. Only 15 gene changes were reversed exclusively by rapamycin. Analysis of the rapamycin-insensitive, mTOR sensitive myofibroblast transcriptome revealed ECM-receptor interaction, metabolism and actin cytoskeleton regulation as major affected pathways.

Combining AGO-PAR-CLIP and RNAseq analysis, we identified a panel of potential miR-450a targets of which many, including TIMMDC1, MT-ND2, ACO2 and ATP5B, regulate energetic metabolism. miR-450a expression indeed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential but increased glucose uptake and viability after glutamine withdrawal, characteristics of less invasive ovarian cancer cell lines, which are also less dependent on glutamine. In summary, we propose in this work that miR-450a acts as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer cells by modulating targets associated with glutaminolysis, which would lead to a decrease in the production of lipids, amino acids and nucleic acids, and also inhibition of signaling pathways associated with EMT",Homo sapiens,miR-450a acts as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer by readjusting energy metabolism

Computational deconvolution of immune infiltrates in 44 NSCLC and matching adjacent normal samples from TCGA showed heterogeneous patterns of alterations in immune cells. The scRNA-seq analyses of 11,485 cells from 4 treatment-naïve NSCLC patients comparing tumor to adjacent normal tissues showed diverse changes of immune cell compositions. Notably, CD8+ T cells and NK cells are present at low levels in adjacent normal tissues, and are further decreased within tumors. Myeloid cells exhibited marked dynamic reprogramming activities, which were delineated with differentiation paths through trajectory analysis. A common differentiation path from CD14+ monocytes to M2 macrophages was identified among the 4 cases, accompanied by up-regulated genes (e.g. ALCAM/CD166, CD59, IL13RA1, IL7R) with enriched functions (adipogenesis, lysosome), and down-regulated genes (e.g. CXCL2, IL1B, IL6R) with enriched functions (TNFa signaling via NF-kB, inflammatory response).

In EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), therapeutic failure of EGFR TKIs can result from both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Histologic and gene expression changes consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been associated with resistance to EGFR TKIs in both experimental models and in patients, and may coincide with genetic mechanisms of resistance such as the EGFRT790M gatekeeper mutation. While therapeutic approaches targeting EGFRT790M have been developed, a strategy for overcoming EMT-related resistance remains unclear. We performed whole-genome CRISPR screening on patient-derived, mesenchymal EGFRT790M-positive cell lines and identified FGFR1 as a critical gene promoting resistance to third generation EGFR TKIs. The FGFR1-3 inhibitor, BGJ398 (infigratinib), resensitized resistant mesenchymal-like cell lines to EGFR inhibition in a synergistic manner. Combining EGFR + FGFR inhibitors also inhibited the in vitro survival and expansion of EGFR mutant drug tolerant cells with mesenchymal-like features prior to the development of drug resistance, and delayed the development of in vivo resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC xenograft tumors. These results suggest that dual EGFR + FGFR blockade may be a promising clinical strategy for preventing and overcoming EMT-associated acquired drug resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC.",Homo sapiens,Targeting FGFR overcomes EMT-mediated resistance in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer

This overexpression frequently correlates with chemoresistance and less favourable prognoses. We previously showed that the activation of RAC1/PAK1 signalling promotes a switch between the BCL6 transcriptional repressor and the STAT5 transcriptional activator at a subset of pro-proliferative gene promoters. Here we used ChIP-Seq, under conditions of pathway inhibition and stimulation, to identify the BCL6/STAT5-switch binding sites throughout the genome. Using a knowledge-driven pipeline for ChIP-Seq data analysis, we identify 3774 genomic features associated to the switch-motif, with a significant enrichment in protein-coding genes involved in DNA damage repair pathways. Stimulation of RAC1/PAK1 signalling in DLD-1 CRC cells increased the expression of these genes and significantly enhanced DNA repair in response to damage induced by alkylating agents.

In HepG2/metR cells, glycolysis rates were increased by more than 3 folds compared with parental cells, and consequently, lactate production was also highly enhanced.

As the results, 614 differentially expressed protein-coding transcripts were identified, which are enriched in cancer related pathways and consist of 95 known RBPs.

Despite of considerable advance in molecular classification of GBMs, no improvements in therapy have been described. The scenario is further complicated by tumor heterogeneity and the relationship among genetic, transcriptional and functional findings. Classically, gene expression has been evaluated by steady-state mRNA, however, this does not take translational control into consideration, which contributes considerably to the composition of the proteome. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptomic and translatomic signature of a GBM obtained from a single patient focusing in tumor heterogeneity. In a sampling of eight fragments, we investigated the translation rates, mTORC1 and ERK1/2 pathways and identified both total and polysome associated mRNAs. An increased translation rate was observed in fragments with high-grade histological features. High-grade histology was also associated with the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis, in both transcriptomes and translatomes. However, genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stress response, were observed only in translatomes from high-grade fragments.

However this drift has not been demonstrated in neoplastic tissues. Here we identify and validate 781 CpG-islands (CGIs) that undergo significant methylomic drift in normal colorectal tissues continue to drift in neoplasia and remain significantly correlated with one another across tissue samples. However compared with normal colon this drift advances (~3-4 fold) faster in neoplasia consistent with increased cell proliferation during neoplastic progression. Furthermore we show that the observed drift patterns are broadly consistent with modeled adenoma-carcinoma sojourn time distributions from colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence data. These results support the hypothesis that beginning with the founder premalignant cell cancer precursors frequently sojourn for decades before turning into cancer which implies that the founder cell typically arises early in life. We estimate that at least 77-89% of the observed drift variance in distal and rectal tumors is explained by stochastic variability associated with neoplastic progression while only 55% of the variance is explained for proximal tumors. However >50% of identified gene-CGI pairs in the proximal colon that undergo drift are significantly and mainly negatively correlated with cancer gene expression suggesting that methylomic drift participates in the clonal evolution of CRCs. Significance: Methylomic drift advances in colorectal neoplasia consistent with extended sojourn time distributions explaining a significant fraction of epigenetic heterogeneity in CRCs.

A transcriptional feed-forward circuitry of NOTCH-family transcription factors amplifies the NOTCH signaling levels, explaining the swift transition between two semi-stable cellular states. This transition induces genome-wide remodeling of the H3K27ac landscape and a switch from ADRN SEs to MES SEs. Once established, the NOTCH feed-forward loop maintains the induced MES state.

Viral cure cannot fully eliminate the risk of disease progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in advanced liver disease. The mechanisms for establishment of infection, liver disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis are only partially understood. To address these questions, we probed the functional proteogenomic architecture of HCV infection within a hepatocyte-model. Methods: Time-resolved HCV infection of hepatocyte-like cells was analyzed by RNA sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, and leveraged by integrative genomic analyses. Using differential expression, gene set enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction mapping we identified pathways relevant for liver disease pathogenesis that we validated in livers of 216 cirrhotic patients with HCV. Results: We uncovered marked changes in the protein expression of gene sets involved in innate immunity, metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis. In infected cells, HCV enhances glucose metabolism and creates a Warburg-like shift of the lactate flux. HCV infection impaired the formation of peroxisomes -organelles required for long-chain fatty acid oxidation- causing intracellular fatty acid accumulation, which is a hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ex vivo studies confirmed perturbed peroxisomes and revealed an association of hepatic catalase expression with clinical outcomes and phenotypes in HCV-associated cirrhosis, NAFLD and HCC cohorts.

Their characteristics and prognostic gene signature in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have been recognized. Heterogeneity of CAFs has long been observed, however, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs between patients and their genetic basis are far less known. Here, we report the distinction of two CAF subtypes obtained from primary cultures of CAFs and matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from 28 resected NSCLC. These 28 pathological NSCLC (82 % adenocarcinoma) were categorized into two types according to the histological properties of the peritumoral stroma: High desmoplasia (HD; n=14), and low desmoplasia (LD; n=14), and the prognostic significance evaluated. This classification seems to align with functional CAFs, as those with HD have higher rate of gel contraction, higher rate of tumor growth and poor prognosis. To demonstrate a gene expression profile specific to CAF activity we used Illumina DASAL Microarray gene expression analysis on extracted RNA from 24 CAF cell lines (12 CAFs-HD and 12 CAFs-LD) that were embedded in collagen gel for 24 hours. From the CAF cohort, the most significant genes that are correlated with the desmoplasia are identified to be enriched in the clinical cohort of 181 NSCLC patients. Overall, our studies showed that in NSCLC, desmoplasia is significantly associated with poor prognosis and is able to significantly subgroup CAF between NSCLC patients.",Homo sapiens,Desmoplasia is associated with carcinoma associated fibroblasts’ heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer patients

Here, we demonstrate that this compound impairs cancer cell viability through induction of senescence and apoptotic cell death in a p53-independent manner. In vivo results corroborate those obtained in in vitro, showing that 20A elicits an important tumor growth inhibition in HeLa-xenografted tumor model. The transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal the functional enrichment in the growth arrest, DDR and lysosomal pathways upon 20A treatment. More particularly, we find that ATM and autophagy are activated upon 20A treatment. Genetic inhibition of ATM following 20A treatment inhibits both autophagy and senescence and directs cells to apoptosis. Moreover, loss of autophagy by deletion of two essential autophagy genes ATG5 and ATG7 leads to failure of CHK1 activation and increased cell death triggered by 20A. Our results therefore identify ATM as a critical determinant in the balance between senescence and apoptosis and uncover autophagy as one of the key mediators of such regulation. Thus, targeting the ATM/autophagy pathway might be a promising strategy to achieve the maximal therapeutic effect of the 20A G4-ligand.",Homo sapiens,Modulation of the ATM/autophagy pathway tips the balance between senescence and apoptosis in response to 20A ligand

Gene sets and gene ontology terms related to mesoderm and endoderm differentiation were enriched after 48 hours of BA treatment. After 14 days of differentiation, BA-treated cells expressed genes indicative of mesoderm and endoderm-derived tissue types, including lung, kidney and adipose tissue. BA treatment was readily incorporated into existing protocols for chondrogenic and endothelial progenitor cell differentiation. Teratomas formed from BA-treated cells contained higher ratios of mesoderm and endoderm to ectoderm tissue compared to PSC-derived teratomas. Collectively, these data demonstrate that single-cell seeding with BA treatment is a powerful method for induction of mesendoderm that can be integrated into protocols for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.",Homo sapiens,Transcriptomically-guided mesendoderm induction of human pluripotent stem cells using a systematically defined culture scheme

Despite previous advances in PWWP domains, the molecular basis by which HRP3 interacts with chromatin is unclear. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the HRP3 PWWP domain in complex with various double-stranded DNAs with/without bound histone peptides. We found that HRP3 PWWP bound to the phosphate backbone of the DNA minor groove and showed a preference for DNA molecules bearing a narrow minor groove width. In addition, HRP3 PWWP preferentially bound to histone peptides bearing the H3K36me3/2 modification. HRP3 PWWP uses two adjacent surfaces to bind both DNA and histone substrates simultaneously, enabling us to generate a model illustrating the recruitment of PWWP to H3K36me3-containing nucleosomes. Cell-based analysis indicated that both DNA and histone binding by the HRP3 PWWP domain are important for HRP3 recruitment to chromatin in vivo.

CXCR7, known as an atypical G-coupled receptor, is engaged in many physiological and pathological processes. Here we show that in prostate cancer CXCR7 is tightly regulated by androgen receptor (AR), which directly binds to CXCR7 gene promoter and enhancer and represses its transcription.

Large-scale phosphoproteomic and in silico analyses indicated that the therapeutic potential of β-sitosterol was linked to mitochondrial interference. Mechanistically, β-sitosterol effectively reduced mitochondrial respiration and respiratory capacity in melanoma cells, mediated by a selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. This led to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. Notably, we observed completely abrogated BRAF inhibitor resistance when vemurafenib was combined with either β-sitosterol or a functional knockdown of mitochondrial complex I.

The tumor-suppressive TET enzymes, which are involved in DNA demethylation, are decreased in prostate cancer (PCa); in particular, TET2 is specifically targeted by androgen-dependent mechanisms of repression in PCa and may play a central role in carcinogenesis. Thus, identification of key genes targeted by TET2 dysregulation may provide further insight into cancer biology. Results: Using a CRISPR/Cas9-derived TET2-knockout prostate cell line, and through whole-transcriptome and whole-methylome sequencing, we identified seven candidate genes – ASB2, ETNK2, MEIS2, NRG1, NTN1, NUDT10, and SRPX – exhibiting reduced expression and increased promoter methylation, a pattern characteristic of tumor suppressors. Decreased expression of these genes significantly discriminates between recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=423), and ASB2, NUDT10, and SRPX were significantly correlated with lower recurrence-free survival in patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis. ASB2, MEIS2, and SRPX also showed significantly lower expression in high-risk Gleason score 8 tumors as compared to low or intermediate risk tumors, suggesting that these genes may be particularly useful as indicators of PCa progression. Furthermore, methylation array probes in the TCGA dataset, which were proximal to the highly conserved, differentially methylated sites identified in our TET2-knockout cells, were able to significantly distinguish between matched prostate tumor and normal prostate tissues (n=50 pairs). Except ASB2, all genes exhibited significantly increased methylation at these probes, and methylation status of at least one probe for each of these genes showed association with measures of PCa progression such as recurrence, stage, or Gleason score. Since ASB2 did not have any probes within the TET2-knockout differentially methylated region, we validated ASB2 methylation in an independent series of matched tumor-normal samples (n=19) by methylation-specific qPCR, which revealed concordant and significant increases in promoter methylation within the TET2-knockout site. Conclusions: Our study identifies seven genes governed by TET2 loss in PCa which exhibit association between their methylation and expression status and measures of PCa progression. As differential methylation profiles and TET2 expression are associated with advanced PCa, further investigation of these specialized TET2 targets may provide important insights into patterns of carcinogenic gene dysregulation.",Homo sapiens,Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression

Herein, we show that co-expression of FLT3-N676K and KMT2A-MLLT3 in human CD34+ cord blood cells primarily cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and rarely acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in immunodeficient mice. By contrast, expression of KMT2A-MLLT3 alone cause ALL, double-positive leukemia (DPL, expressing both CD33 and CD19), or bilineal leukemia (BLL, comprised of distinct myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells), and rarely AML. Further, AML could only be serially propagated with maintained immunophenotype in secondary recipients when cells co-expressed KMT2A-MLLT3 and FLT3-N676K. Consistent with the idea that activated signaling would allow myeloid cells to engraft and maintain their self-renewal capacity, in a secondary recipient, a de novo KRAS-G13D was identified in myeloid cells previously expressing only KMT2A-MLLT3. Gene expression profiling revealed that KMT2A-MLLT3 DPL had a highly similar gene expression profile to ALL, with both expressing key lymphoid transcription factors and ALL cell surface markers, in line with the DPL cells being ALL cells with aberrant expression of CD33.

Our ability to prevent or treat de novo and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is limited by our incomplete understanding of the epigenetic disruption that is central to this process, including improper histone methylation. We performed a comprehensive analysis of 16 histone H3 genes in 434 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and identified mutations in adult and pediatric cases (1.6%), with a higher incidence in secondary AML (s-AML) (9%). These included four novel amino acid substitutions (Q69H, A26P, R2Q and R8H) as well as K27M and K27I in H3.1 and H3.3 genes. These mutations are important early events in leukemogenesis as they were observed in pre-leukemic HSCs in two cases and were in the major clones in every sample. Consistent with a role in pre-leukemic HSC clonal expansion, the mutant histones increased functional human HSC frequency and altered differentiation along the erythroid and myeloid lineages, with activity dependent on the specific mutation (K27M, K27I and Q69H). In established human leukemia, the K27M/I mutant histones amplified leukemic aggressiveness, with increased proliferation, expansion of leukemic progenitor and blast cells, and superior competitiveness in vivo. This was associated with increased expression in genes involved in erythrocyte and myeloid differentiation, correlated with a corresponding decrease in histone H3 K27 tri-methylation and increase in K27 acetylation. While histone mutations can co-occur with alterations in RUNX1, we observed that the functional impact of histone mutations is independent of RUNX1 mutations.

In order to characterize the factors associated with heterogeneity in response to ibuprofen, we performed functional neuroimaging, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, biochemical assays, and gene expression analysis in twenty-nine healthy subjects who underwent third molar extraction. Subjects were treated with rapid-acting ibuprofen (400 mg; N=19) or placebo (N=10) in a randomized, double-blind design. Compared to placebo, ibuprofen-treated subjects exhibited greater reduction in pain scores, alterations in CBF in brain regions associated with pain processing, and inhibition of ex vivo COX-1 and COX-2 activity and urinary prostaglandin metabolites (p<0.05). Ibuprofen-treated subjects could be stratified into partial responders (N=9, required rescue medication) and complete responders (N=10, no rescue medication). This variability in analgesic efficacy was not associated with demographic/clinical characteristics, markers of systemic inflammation, or ibuprofen pharmacokinetics. Complete responders exhibited less suppression of urinary prostaglandin metabolites and greater induction of serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 8, compared to partial responders (p<0.05). Partial responders exhibited more alterations in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after surgery, with an enrichment in inflammatory pathways.

We have previously reported that the PI3K pathway regulates ER-dependent transcription in breast cancer through the phosphorylation of the epigenetic regulator KMT2D by AKT. Here, we provide new insights into how the PI3K pathway propagates its effects to control KMT2D and ER function via SGK1, another PI3K downstream effector. Specifically, we show that PI3K inhibition, via a negative feedback loop, activates SGK1 to promote chromatin-based regulation of ER-dependent gene expression. PI3K/AKT inhibitors activate ER, which subsequently promotes SGK1 transcription through direct binding to its promoter. Elevated SGK1, in turn, phosphorylates KMT2D, suppressing its function and altering the chromatin landscape to attenuate ER-dependent expression. Thus, we have determined that SGK1 regulates the chromatin landscape and ER-dependent transcription via the direct phosphorylation of KMT2D. These findings reveal an ER-SGK1-KMT2D signaling circuit aimed to attenuate ER response through a previously unknown role for SGK1 to program chromatin and ER transcriptional output.",Homo sapiens,PI3K inhibition activates SGK1 via a feedback loop to promote chromatin-based regulation of ER-dependent gene expression

In ixazomib-treated TCL and HL cells, we observed induction of proteasomal gene expression and NRF2 as a prominent upstream regulator. Ixazomib treatment in TCL and HL cells resulted in transient inhibition followed by full recovery of proteasomal activity within 72 hours. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis following belinostat treatment resulted in downregulation of both NRF2 and proteasomal gene expression (validated by qPCR) without direct impact on proteasomal activity in Jurkat and L428. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of NRF2 in Jurkat cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability with ixazomib compared with untreated control cells.

Both CD4+ ‘helper’ and CD8+ cytotoxic CAR-T cells are equally effective in directly killing target tumor cells and their cytotoxic activity is associated with the elevation of a range of TH1 and TH2 signature cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα, IL5, and IL13), as confirmed by the expression of master transcription factors TBX21 (Tbet) and GATA-3. However, rather than conforming to stringent TH1 or TH2 subtypes, single-cell analysis reveals that the predominant response is a highly mixed TH1/TH2 function in the same cell and the regulatory T cell (Treg) activity, although observed in a small fraction of activated cells, emerges from this hybrid TH1/TH2 population. GM-CSF is produced from the majority of cells regardless of the polarization states, further contrasting CAR-T to classic T cells. Surprisingly, the cytokine response is minimally associated with differentiation status although all major differentiation subsets such as naïve, central memory, effector memory and effector are detected. All these suggest that the activation of CAR-engineered T cells is a canonical process that leads to a highly mixed response combining both type 1 and type 2 cytokines together with GM-CSF, supporting the notion that ‘polyfunctional’ CAR-T cells correlate with objective response of patients in clinical trials.

Methods: Co-immunoprecipitation experiments (CoIP) to characterize BRD4 interaction and functional consequences of inhibiting transcriptional elongation were assessed using drugs targeting of BRD4 or CDK9, either alone or in combination. Results: CoIP revealed an interaction of BRD4 with EWS-FLI1 and CDK9 in EwS.

Our findings provide comprehensive mechanistic insight into the ineffectiveness that defines HDAC inhibitors as a monotherapy for CRC. We identified that inhibition of HDAC2 promotes the emergence of a super-oncogenic KRAS by inducing K5 acetylation that fosters a previously undiscovered electrostatic interaction with R67 conserved in RAF kinases. This post-translational modification facilitates an increase in the binding affinity to this family of downstream RAS effectors, which translates into an immediate and persistent hyperactivation of the downstream MAPK-signaling. The concomitant instability of its co-conspirator c-MYC enables cells selectively harboring oncogenic KRAS to enter a protective state of reversible cell cycle arrest characterized by a senescence-like phenotype.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether Src inhibition and oxaliplatin treatment exerted synergistic effects on HCC cell lines. Methods: The antitumor effects of combined treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin on proliferation were evaluated in HCC cells as well as in saracatinib- and oxaliplatin-resistant HCC cell lines using cell viability assays, plate colony formation assays, and cell cycle distribution detection. RNA sequencing was used to explore the resistance mechanism, and the effects on ABCG1 and Wnt signaling in oxaliplatin resistance were confirmed. Results: Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and saracatinib individually induced strong anti-HCC effects, while combined or sequential treatment of HCC cells with these two drugs exhibited reduced efficacy compared to treatment with the single drugs. Furthermore, treatment with saracatinib caused oxaliplatin resistance. RNA sequencing revealed 458 genes that were altered by treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin. Of these, the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 ABCG1 and Wnt-associated genes were significantly upregulated. Upregulation of ABCG1 and oxaliplatin resistance were associated with activation of Wnt signaling. Interference with ABCG1 expression or inhibition of Wnt signaling resulted in reversal of the saracatinib-induced oxaliplatin resistance in the HCC cell lines.

We applied RNAseq analysis from patient-derived data with validation in independent cohort of patients. We followed these studies with gene regulation analysis as well as experimental dissection of the role of the identified lncRNA by multiple in vitro and in vivo methods. We analyzed RNA-seq data from tumors of 456 CRC patients compared to normal samples, and identified SNHG15 as a potentially oncogenic lncRNA that encodes a snoRNA in one of its introns. The processed SNHG15 is overexpressed in CRC tumors and its expression is highly correlated with poor survival of patients. Interestingly, SNHG15 is more highly expressed in tumors with high levels of MYC expression, while MYC protein binds to two E-box motifs on SNHG15 sequence, indicating that SNHG15 transcription is directly regulated by the oncogene MYC. The depletion of SNHG15 by siRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, decreases colony formation as well as the tumorigenic capacity of CRC cells, whereas its overexpression leads to opposite effects. Gene expression analysis performed upon SNHG15 inhibition showed changes in multiple relevant genes implicated in cancer progression, including MYC, NRAS, BAG3 or ERBB3. Several of these genes are functionally related to AIF, a protein that we found to specifically interact with SNHG15, suggesting that the SNHG15 acts, at least in part, by regulating the activity of AIF. Interestingly, ROS levels, which are directly regulated by AIF, show a significant reduction in SNHG15-depleted cells. Moreover, knockdown of SNHG15 increases the sensitiveness of the cells to 5-FU, while its overexpression renders them more resistant to the chemotherapeutic drug. Altogether, these results describe an important role of SNHG15 in promoting colon cancer and mediating drug resistance, suggesting its potential as prognostic marker and target for RNA-based therapies.",Homo sapiens,"SNHG15 is a bifunctional MYC-regulated noncoding locus encoding a lncRNA that promotes cell proliferation, invasion and drug resistance in colorectal cancer by interacting with AIF"

N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 10 (GALNT10) is a GalNAc-transferase that initiates protein O-glycosylation. The aim of this study was to explore the role of GALNT10 in lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to study the expression of GALNT10 in an lung adenocarcinoma tissue microarray. We found that GALNT10 is frequently down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and is associated with pathological classification and TNM stage. Additionally, we demonstrated that knockdown of GALNT10 with small interference (si) RNA promoted cell proliferation, cell colony formation and cell invasion capacity in A549 cells by using CCK8 assay, flow cytometry, cell colony formation, and transwell invasion assay.Moreover, whole genome microarray analysis showed that 287 genes were up-regulated and 137 were down-regulated in A549 cells upon GALNT10 knockdown. Functional enrichment analysis reveal that GALNT10 knockdown in A549 cells leads to differential gene expression in pathways, including TNF signaling pathway. These findings suggest that down-regulation of GALNT10 plays an important role in the cell proliferation and invasive behavior of lung adenocarcinoma via modifying O-glycosylation and activity of TNF pathway. In addition, we suggest that GALNT10 may be a tumor suppressor gene in lung adenocarcinoma and that targeting GALNT10 could be a promising approach for lung adenocarcinoma therapy.",Homo sapiens,GALNT10 knockdown in A549 cell line and over-expressing in the H322 cell line

Unlike mechanisms resulting in complete and permanent antigen loss, those leading to antigen-low tumour escape remain obscure. In murine leukaemia models, we show that CARs provoke reversible antigen loss through trogocytosis, an active process whereby target antigen is transferred to T cells, thereby decreasing target density on tumour cells and abating T cell activity by promoting fratricide killing and exhaustion.

To study malignant myelopoiesis, it is essential to understand the ontology of the different celltypes. In a generally accepted model for hematopoietic differentiation, all myeloid cells are preceded by a common granulocyte and macrophage progenitor that has the potential for all myeloid celltypes at the single cell level. However, we recently proposed a model for mouse hematopoiesis in which myeloid cells are formed via two independent pathways, one leading towards macrophages and neutrophils and one leading towards eosinophils, basophils and mast cells. The first pathway is affiliated with lymphoid potentials whereas the latter with megakaryocyte/erythroid development. Here, we demonstrate that those findings translate to human hematopoiesis.

Here, we show that BLM-deficient cells exhibit a constitutively upregulated inflammatory interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature. Restoring BLM expression reverts ISG expression to baseline. ISG expression in BLM-deficient fibroblasts is mediated by the cGAS-STING-IRF3 cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. Increased DNA damage or downregulation of the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1 enhances ISG expression in BS fibroblasts, and cytoplasmic micronuclei positive for cGAS are increased in BLM-deficient fibroblasts. Finally, BS patients demonstrate elevated ISG expression in peripheral blood. We conclude that BLM is essential to limit the expression of pro-inflammatory genes resulting from the sensing of DNA damage products by the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway.

However, there is currently no microfluidics-based high-throughput assay available that allows this analysis. To resolve this, we developed a new method for concurrent sequencing of the transcriptome and targeted genomic regions (CORTAD-seq) within the same single cell on a microfluidic high-throughput platform. Its operation is simple, at moderate reagent cost, with excellent data quality and good accessibility for a broad scientific community. We implemented this new method to dissect the cellular consequences of mutations that result in resistance to targeted therapy. Using different tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant PC9 lung cancer cell lines as our study model, we detected signatures of TKI resistant genes as well as expansion of T790M mutation and EGFR amplification in the resistant cells. Interestingly, we identify transcriptomic characteristics for resistance that are not dependent on the presence of T790M, the most common resistance mutation in EGFR, indicating that phenotypically similar resistance scenarios can emerge without T790M mutation and other genomic alterations or epigenetic modifications are required for the manifestation of the resistance phenotype. Cumulatively, the application of this method allows accurate evaluation of the genomic and transcriptomic changes in cancer during development of drug resistance at single cell level in uncovering potential new biomarker and therapeutic targets in resistant cancer.",Homo sapiens,Concurrent single cell RNA and targeted DNA sequencing on a microfluidics device allows high-throughput identification of transcriptome and genome alterations during the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells

The goal of this study is to characterize functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specific CD8+ T cell clones using single cell RNAseq Methods: PBMCs from Mtb exposed patients were stimulated ex vivo with Mtb lysate for 12 hours. Activated CD8+ T cells were selected and single cell sorted based on the upregulation of activation markers, including CD154 and CD137. Results: Using an optimized Smart-seq2 protocol, we could successfully combine TCR sequencing with transcriptome sequencing on single T cell. TCR sequence analysis allows us to preferentially identify and select expanded conventional CD8+ T cells as well as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. In summary, we analyzed 921 single cells with 2,500-3000 detected genes for each cell. The iNKT and MAIT cells have a nearly superimposable transcriptional pattern, indicating that they are variations of the same cell type, and differ considerably from conventional CD8+ T cells. While there are no distinct gene expression differences between clonally expanded versus unique iNKT or MAIT cells, highly expanded conventional CD8+ T cells downregulate the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha (IL2RA, or CD25) protein and show signs of senescence. This suggests inherent limits to clonal expansion that act to diversify the T cell response repertoire. Conclusions: we combine targeted TCR sequencing with a sensitive RNA-seq protocol that yields both paired TCR sequences and extensive transcriptional information on single T cells. This enables the selection of rare, clonal and specific T cell subtypes, enabling analysis of their transcriptomes. Our targeted approach allowed us to efficiently and economically select clonal cells with a sensitive clone size dynamic range. And by using a short ex vivo stimulation (12~24 hours) to identify pathogen-responsive T cells, we could circumvent long-term ex vivo culture artifacts. By leveraging single cell analysis of clonal T cells in additional contexts we may improve our understanding of immune system responses to diseases such as cancer, additional infections, as well as aid in vaccine development.",Homo sapiens,Paired TCR and transcriptome analysis of single T cells characterizes clonally expanded human conventional and unconventional CD8+ T cells

CD99, a hallmark surface molecule of EWS, participates in crucial biological processes including cell migration, differentiation and death. EWS cells can release CD99 through exosomes, specialized extracellular vesicles with major cell communication roles. Here we show that, as a consequence of CD99 silencing, EWS cells deliver exosomes with oncosuppressive functions which significantly reduce tumor aggressiveness. These CD99-lacking microvesicles modulate gene expression of the EWS recipient cells, reduce proliferation and migration, in turn inducing a more differentiated less malignant phenotype. The most relevant effects were detected on the AP-1 signaling pathway whose regulation was found to be dependent on the specific cargo loaded in vesicles after CD99 shutdown. Investigation of the miRNA content of CD99-deprived exosomes identified miR-199a-3p as a key driver to reverse EWS malignancy in experimental models as well as in clinical specimens. All together our data provide evidence that the abrogation of CD99 in EWS tumor cells leads to produce and release exosomes capable to transfer their antineoplastic effects into the nearby tumor cells, suggesting a novel atypical role for these microvesicles in reversion of malignancy rather than in priming the soil for progression and metastatic seeding.

In support of a physiologically pivotal role for SIX-proteins in host immunity, human SIX1 transgene suppressed inflammation and promoted the recovery of mice from endotoxic shock.

The guarded prognosis for SS reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due in part to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. Using single-cell sequencing of RNA, we confirm that SS is a clonal disease, but we further define a more complex model featuring distinct transcriptomic states within SS. Our analysis showed the involvement of FOXP3+ malignant T cells during clonal evolution, transitioning from FOXP3+ T cells to GATA3+ or IKZF2+ (HELIOS) tumor cells.

Here we show that activation of MYCN in human neuroblastoma cells induces promoter escape of RNAPII. If pause release of RNAPII fails, MYCN recruits the BRCA1 protein to promoter-proximal regions. Recruitment of BRCA1 prevents MYCN-dependent accumulation of stalled RNAPII and enhances transcriptional activation by MYCN. Mechanistically, BRCA1 stabilizes mRNA de-capping complexes and enables MYCN to suppress R-loop formation in promoter-proximal regions. Recruitment of BRCA1 is mediated by the ubiquitin-specific protease, USP11, which binds specifically to MYCN that is de-phosphorylated at Thr58. Thr58 phosphorylation promotes proteasomal turnover of MYCN, hence BRCA1 stabilizes chromatin association of MYCN.

KLF6 expression is supported by one of the strongest super enhancers in ccRCC cells. Inhibition of KLF6 in several ccRCC cell lines impaired cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and reduced metastatic lung colonization. KLF6 depletion led to downregulation of lipid homeostasis pathways downstream of SREBF1 and SREBF2, suggesting a role for KLF6 as a regulator of mTOR. We find that KLF6 modulates mTORC1 activity in ccRCC via transcriptionally regulating the expression of PDGFB, an activator of the PIK3-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway. Targeting PDGFB in ccRCC inhibited mTORC1, and supplementing KLF6-depleted cells with recombinant PDGFB rescued mTORC1 activity. Our data suggest that a robust super enhancer that integrates signals from multiple pathways, including the ccRCC-initiating VHL-HIF2A pathway, supports an autocrine PDGFB-dependent signalling loop that promotes mTOR activity in ccRCC. These results suggest the possibility that combining low dose PDGFR and mTOR inhibition could be a viable therapeutic strategy for ccRCC.",Homo sapiens,Histone mark profiling in renal cancer cells

We find that GSK3 inhibition activates a cell cycle network whereas MST1 inhibition drives the mevalonate pathway, with synergistic activation of proliferation. However, all GSK3 inhibitors tested also reduce contractile force in hCO. We screened for small molecule activators of cardiomyocyte proliferation that did not alter contractile force in hCOs. This was overcome by screening of a boutique compound library, identifying a p38 inhibitor, which activated a cell cycle network without reducing force. The screen also identified a TGFBR inhibitor that induces the mevalonate pathway and can also synergise to activate proliferation. RNA sequencing was performed to investigate underlying mechanisms of action. Methods: RNA samples were processed with Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library prep kit selecting for poly(A) taled RNA following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Libraries were quantified with Qubit HS (ThermoFisher) and Fragment Analyzer (Advances Analytical Technologies) adjusted to the appropriate concentration for sequencing. Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced at a final concentration of 1.8 pM on an Illumina NextSeq 500 high-output run using paired-end chemistry with 75 bp read length. The sequencing data was demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq2-v2.17. The quality of the reads was assessed thanks to FastQC. The reads were then processed and mapped to the human genome hg38 using the Bcbio-nextgen framework version 1.0.3. The aligner used was HISAT2 2.0.5. Raw counts were normalised and analysed with DESeq2. Results: Analysis of RNAseq data lead to the understanding that compound 3 regulated the cell cycle network, which was similar to GSK3 inhibitors, whereas compound 65 regulated the mevalonate network, which was similarly to MST1 inhibitors. Conclusions: The current study adds to a growing body of evidence that alterations in cardiomyocyte metabolism may be a cause rather than a consequence of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest. Controlling cellular metabolism is emerging as a key strategy in the fight against cancer but the same pathways may conversely be required for the development of cardiac regenerative therapies.",Homo sapiens,Screening in Human Cardiac Organoids Identifies a Requirement for the Mevalonate Pathway in Cardiomyocyte Proliferation

Using genome-wide mapping and reference models for 23 human centromeres, CENP-A is shown in early G1 to be assembled into nucleosomes within megabase, repetitive a-satellite DNAs at each centromere and onto 11,390 sites on the chromosome arms. Centromere-bound CENP-A is found to be quantitatively maintained during DNA replication by coordinated action of the MCM2 helicase, CAF1, HJURP, and the CCAN network of constitutive centromere components. CCAN serves to tether CENP-A removed by MCM2, thereby enabling local reassembly onto both daughter centromeres with identical DNA sequence preferences and nucleosome phasing as the loading in G1 and independent of CENP-B. Conversely, without CCAN-mediated tethering, DNA replication removes CENP-A from sites on the chromosome arms.

Subsequently, 74, 598 and 1204 target genes of these DE miRNAs were predicted in three comparisons, and GO and KEGG analysis revealed that multiple target genes were associated with proliferation and apoptosis of PC cells.

In this study we performed gene expression profiling on tissues from this trial in order to identify markers associated with progression free survival and treatment response in this well-defined cohort of patients. Methods: Gene expression profiling, performed on 195 samples, was used to assign tumors to one of six intrinsic glioma subtypes (IGS; molecularly similar tumors predefined by unsupervised gene expression analysis) and to extract the cellular composition of immune infiltrates. DNA copy number changes were determined on samples assigned to IGS-16. Results: We confirm that IGS-subtypes are prognostic in EORTC22033-26033 clinical trial samples. Specific genetic changes segregate in distinct IGS subtypes: most samples assigned to IGS-9 have IDH-mutations combined with 1p19q codeletion, samples assigned to IGS-17 have IDH-mutations with intact 1p19q chromosomal arms and samples assigned to other intrinsic subtypes often are IDH-wildtype and 1p19q intact. A trend towards benefit from RT compared to TMZ was observed for samples assigned to IGS-9 (HR for TMZ is 1.90, 95% CI [0.95, 3.80], P=0.065), but not for samples assigned to IGS-17 (HR for TMZ vs RT is 0.87, 95% CI[0.50, 1.51], P=0.62). We did not identify genes significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS) within intrinsic subtypes, though follow-up time is limited. We also show that LGGs and GBMs differ in their immune-infiltrate with LGGs having higher suppressor and lower effector cell populations compared to GBMs. This suggests that LGGs are less amenable to checkpoint inhibitor type immune therapies than GBMs. Gene expression analysis and copy number analysis also identified one patient with a pilocytic astrocytoma (PA).

To date, 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reproducibly associated with LUAD susceptibility. However, as most SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are not located in the coding regions of genes and are co-inherited with hundreds of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), mechanistic links to disease outcomes remain largely unexplored. We hypothesized that some SNPs increase LUAD risk by affecting enhancers of gene transcription in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), the purported cells of origin for LUAD. Forty-six LUAD risk-associated SNPs mapped to putative AEC enhancers, and 11 of these were located in FAIRE peaks. Of those, seven were predicted to form transcription factor binding motifs. For four of these, ChIPseq data confirmed the binding of the predicted transcription factors. We chose rs452384, rs6942067 and rs11364096 for functional validation. The reference (risk) allele for rs452384 forms an NKX2-1 binding site that is disrupted by the alternate allele, elicited a 42% increase in activity in H1648 LUAD cells relative to the alternative allele (P = 6.7 x 10-3), and was associated with elevated TERT levels in esophageal tissue (P = 6 x 10-8). The reference (risk) allele for rs6942067 forms an EP300 binding site disrupted by the alternate allele, elicits a 94% increase in enhancer activity relative to the alternative allele in H1648 LUAD cells (P = 2.7 x 10-2), and was associated with higher expression of potential oncogene DCBLD1 in blood (P = 5.2 x 10-16). Lastly, the alternate (risk) allele for rs11364096 disrupts binding sites for FOXA1, HDAC2 and SP1, elicits a 32% decrease in enhancer activity in A549 LUAD cells relative to the reference allele (P = 5.7 x 10-3), and LUAD data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicates that this SNP is associated with altered expression in LUAD of four genes on other chromosomes. Our analyses provide possible mechanisms for the genetic susceptibility to LUAD, with the identification of three strong functional SNP candidates that appear to affect AEC enhancers.

To gain insight into the mechanism of this programming, phenotypic, functional and transcriptome analyses were performed in mesenchymal stem cells derived from human dental pulp (DPSCs) and bone marrow (BMSCs). DPSCs and BMSCs had similar morphologies and flow cytometric profiles, and were capable of tri-lineage differentiation into osteoblast, adipocyte and chondocyte. However, compared with BMSCs, DPSCs increased in osteogenic potential, decreased in adipogenic potential, and formed dentin-pulp-like complexes in vivo. Genome-wide RNA-seq and differential expression analysis revealed that signalings such as, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/PI3K/AKT pathway, and cancer-related pathway were different in both cells. Differential PTEN expression, higher in DPSCs than BMSCs, was responsible for the lineage commitment and tumorigenesis differences in both cells. Besides, BMSCs decreased in PTEN DNA methylation compared to DPSCs, which was mediated by increased DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) expression. Furthermore, histone methyltransferase G9a mediated repressive epigenetic mark H3K9Me2 was selectively enriched in BMSCs. Moreover, DPSCs were more resistant to oncogenic transformation than BMSCs. To link lineage commitment with tumorigenesis, we demonstrated that DPSCs were more resistant to oncogenic transformation than BMSCs and PTEN deficiency increased the sensitivity of DPSCs for tumorigenic transformation.

Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that differs from apoptosis and results from iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation. Although it was mechanistically illuminated in vitro, emerging evidence has shown that ferroptosis may be implicated in a variety of pathological scenarios. However, the involvement of ferroptosis in T cell immunity and cancer immunotherapy is unknown. Here, we find that immunotherapy-activated CD8+ T cells enhance ferroptosis-specific lipid peroxidation in tumor cells, and in turn, increased ferroptosis contributes to the anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapy. Mechanistically, IFNg released from CD8+ T cells downregulates expression of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11, two subunits of glutamate-cystine antiporter system xc-, restrains tumor cell cystine uptake, and as a consequence, promotes tumor cell lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In preclinical models, depletion of cyst(e)ine by cyst(e)inase in combination with checkpoint blockade synergistically enhances T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and induces tumor cell ferroptosis. Thus, T cell-promoted tumor ferroptosis is a novel anti-tumor mechanism.

Senescent cells are characterized by an upregulation of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines, which is termed as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). NAD+ metabolism plays a critical role in both tissue aging and cancer. However, the role of NAD+ metabolism in regulating the SASP is not well understood. Here we show that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD+ salvage pathway, governs the strengths of proinflammatory SASP during senescence. In contrast to downregulation of NAMPT during replicative senescence, NAMPT is upregulated during oncogene-induced senescence. NAMPT selectively regulates proinflammatory, but not immunosuppressive, SASP. NAMPT is regulated by HMGA1 through a distal enhancer element during senescence. HMGA1/NAMPT/NAD+ signaling axis promotes proinflammatory SASP through enhancing glycolysis and mitochondria respiration. Mechanistically, HMGA1/NAMPT promotes proinflammatory SASP through NAD+-mediated suppression of AMPK kinase, which suppresses p53-mediated inhibition of p38MAPK to enhance NFb activity. SASP regulation by NAD+ metabolism is independent of senescence-associated cell growth arrest. An increase in NAD+ levels is sufficient to convert SASP from low to high levels during replicative senescence. Together, we conclude that NAD+ metabolism governs the strengths of proinflammatory SASP. Given the tumor promoting effects of proinflammatory SASP, our results suggest that anti-ageing dietary NAD+ augmentation should be administered with precision.",Homo sapiens,NAD+ metabolism governs proinflammatory senescence secretome

Here we show that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) associates with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) to stimulate the induction of innate immune defences against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Following the activation of innate immune signalling, HIRA localized at PML-NBs in a Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK), Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK), and Sp100-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis revealed that HIRA promoted the transcriptional upregulation of a broad repertoire of host genes that regulate innate immunity to HSV-1 infection, including those involved in MHC-I antigen presentation, cytokine signalling, and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that PML, the principle scaffolding protein of PML-NBs, was required for the enrichment of HIRA onto ISGs, identifying a role for PML in the HIRA-dependent regulation of innate immunity to virus infection. Our data identifies independent roles for HIRA in the intrinsic silencing of viral gene expression and the induction of innate immune defences to restrict the initiation and propagation of HSV-1 infection, respectively. These intracellular host defences are antagonized by the HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which disrupts the stable recruitment of HIRA to infecting viral genomes and PML-NBs at spatiotemporally distinct phases of infection.

Here, we profile the transcriptomes of ~ 7000 individual cells at day one post-infection using the 10X genomics platform. We show that viral transcripts are detectable in the majority of the cells, suggesting that virion entry is unlikely to be the main target of cellular restriction mechanisms. We further show that viral replication occurs in a small but specific sub-group of cells transcriptionally related to, and likely derived from, a cluster of cells expressing markers of Colony Forming Unit – Granulocyte, Erythrocyte, Monocyte, Megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) oligopotent progenitors. Compared to the remainder of the population, CFU-GEMM cells are enriched in transcripts with functions in mitochondrial energy production, cell proliferation, RNA processing and protein synthesis, and express similar or higher levels of interferon-related genes. While expression levels of the former are maintained in infected cells, the latter are strongly down-regulated. We thus propose that the preferential infection of CFU-GEMM cells may be due to the presence of a pre-established pro-viral environment, requiring minimal optimization efforts from viral effectors, rather than to the absence of specific restriction factors.

Here we show that BRAFV600E amplification and selumetinib resistance are fully reversible following drug withdrawal. Resistant cells with BRAFV600E amplification become addicted to selumetinib to maintain a precise level of ERK1/2 signalling (2-3% of total ERK1/2 active, here quantified by mass spectrometry), that is optimal for cell survival and proliferation. The magnitude of ERK1/2 activation following selumetinib withdrawal (~20% active) drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, which selects against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. ERK1/2-dependent p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and determines the rate of reversal of selumetinib resistance. Furthermore, growth of selumetinib-resistant cells with BRAFV600E amplification as tumour xenografts is inhibited in mice that do not receive selumetinib. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, providing a rationale for intermittent dosing to forestall resistance. In striking contrast, selumetinib resistance driven by KRASG13D amplification is not reversible. In these cells ERK1/2 reactivation does not inhibit proliferation but drives a ZEB1-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that increases cell motility and promotes resistance to traditional chemotherapy agents arguing strongly against the use of ‘drug holidays’ in cases of KRASG13D amplification.",Homo sapiens,Withdrawal of MEK1/2 inhibitor reverses acquired resistance driven by BRAF amplification but drives EMT and chemoresistance in cells with amplified KRAS

These chemoresistant cells can remain dormant at secondary sites, such as bone and lung, for years and decades. Cancer cells endowed with drug resistance are maintained in vivo in a quiescent slow-growing state that preserves them from anti-proliferative cancer drugs. The mechanism of conversion from dormancy to growth remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) as master regulators of cancer stem cells (CSCs) maintainance, because one of the characteristics of CSCs is their slow proliferation or dormancy. MiRNA targeting CSCs may be an effective therapy to improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Methods: We performed miRNA array analysis to identify differences miRNA expression profiles between adherent cells and mammospheres that contain higher number of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). In this approach, we focused on expression of hsa-miR-27a. Further, roles of hsa-miR-27a target genes in maintaining BCSC properties were analysed . Results: Here, we showed that hsa-miR-27a was downregulated in mammosphere cells. The formation of BCSCs was attenuated by transfection of hsa-miR-27a. We found that hsa-miR-27a targets F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (FBW7), a tumor suppressor gene, thereby inducing tumor dormancy. Additionally, we found that hsa-miR-27a targets genes involved in GSH synthesis, including xCT (encoded by SLC7A11), a heterodimeric protein of a transporter subunit of the xC(-) system, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH/CSE), and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2), thereby increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Upregulation of these genes by antisense (as)-miR-27a induced autophagy. Conclusions: Previous studies showed that expression of hsa-miR-27a is elevated in breast cancer. Here, we showed that expression of hsa-miR-27a was reduced in BCSC. CSCs in the dormant state are resistant to chemotherapy due to inhibition of ROS accumulation in these cells. These results demonstrate that hsa-miR-27a plays an essential role in maintaining the BCSCs phenotype via regulation of FBW7, ROS related genes and the Nrf2 pathway, as well as in the dormant-to-proliferative switch of breast cancer cells. Thus, hsa-miR-27a represents a novel strategy for various type of breast cancer.",Homo sapiens,miR-27a is a pivotal regulator of the breast cancer stem cell state

We find that in cells and animal models exosome release is inhibited by sustained activation of mTORC1, leading to intracellular accumulation of CD63-positive exosome precursors. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or nutrient and growth factor deprivation stimulates exosome release, which occurs concomitantly with autophagy.

The presence of high-grade persistent or progressive PMLs is a marker of increased lung cancer risk both at the lesion site elsewhere in the lung. Effective tools to identify and treat premalignant lesions at highest risk of progression to invasive carcinoma are lacking. We profiled via RNA-Seq airway brushing and biopsies (divided into two cohorts: discovery and validation) obtained from high-risk smokers undergoing lung cancer screening via serial auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy procedures. We identified four distinct molecular subtypes (Proliferative, Inflammatory, Secretory, and Normal) in the bronchial biopsies that correspond to a spectrum of biological and morphological alterations. The Proliferative subtype was enriched with dysplastic PMLs from current smokers that exhibit up-regulation of KRT5 and KI67 as well as metabolic and cell cycle pathways, and down-regulation of cilium-associated processes and FOXJ1 expression. Molecular subtype classification in the validation cohort biopsies replicated these significant clinical and biological associations. Airway brushes from normal fluorescing areas of the large airway classified as the Proliferative subtype specifically predicts the presence of biopsies of this same subtype. Within the Proliferative subtype, genes associated with interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation were observed to be down-regulated among dysplastic biopsies that persistent or progress in the future. Innate and adaptive immune cells were computationally predicted to be depleted in these biopsies and this was confirmed via immunofluorescence staining of adjacent biopsies.

Design: Three cohorts of primary (except one liver metastases) untreated and fresh frozen CRC samples (n=57) profiled by microarray and RNA-Seq were analyzed. A reduced 38-gene panel (CRCAssigner-38) was selected from the 786-gene CRCAssigner signature (CRCAssigner-786) using an in-house class prediction approach. A customised NanoString Technologies’ nCounter platform-based assay (NanoCRCAssigner) was developed for comparison with different classifiers (CMS subtypes), platforms (microarrays and RNA-Seq), and gene sets (CRCAssigner-38 and CRCAssigner-786). Results: NanoCRCAssigner classified samples (n=48; except those showing a mixture of subtypes) into all five CRCAssigner subtypes with overall high concordance across platforms (>87%) and with CMS subtypes (81%) irrespective of variable tumour cellularity. The association of subtypes with their known molecular (microsatellite-instable and stemness), mutational (KRAS/BRAF), and clinical characteristics (including overall survival) further demonstrated assay validity.

It is believed that chronic infection alters host gene expression and favours HCC development. In particular, HCV replication in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) derived membranes induces chronic ER stress. How HCV replication affects host mRNA translation and transcription at a genome wide level is not yet known. Methods: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days. Results: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression - only around 30 genes are differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress, HCV replication and HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3) may be subject to uORF mediated translation control in response to stress-induced eIF2 inactivation. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes. Conclusion: After establishing HCV replication, cellular gene expression is reprogrammed towards stress response and HCC development. Downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes indicates how a virus induces cancer cell-like metabolic reprogramming (""Warburg effect""). Thus, HCV escapes stress response pathways but induces selective gene expression changes which likely are beneficial for chronic infection and cancerogenesis.",Homo sapiens,Cellular gene expression during Hepatitis C Virus replication revealed by Ribosome profiling

SET1/MLL complexes are the major H3K4 methyltransferase complexes in mammals. The DPY30 subunit is associated with these complexes by forming a dimer that directly binds to the ASH2L subunit in the complexes and facilitates methylation. We have previously established an important role of DPY30 in certain hematologic malignancies including MLL-rearranged leukemia and Burkitt’s lymphoma, but the domain on DPY30 that regulates cancer growth is not evident. Moreover, the potential of pharmacologically targeting this chromatin modulator to inhibit cancer has not been explored. Here we have developed a peptide-based strategy to specifically target DPY30 activity. We have designed cell-penetrating peptides that can either bind to DPY30 or show defective or enhanced binding to DPY30. The DPY30-binding peptides, but not the non-binding peptide, inhibit DPY30’s activity in interacting with ASH2L and in enhancing H3K4 methylation. Treatment with the DPY30-binding, but not the non-binding, peptide significantly inhibited the growth of MLL-rearranged leukemia and other MYC-dependent hematologic cancer cells including Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. These results strongly support a critical role of the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 in promoting the growth of certain blood cancers, and also demonstrate a proof-of-principle for the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 for potential cancer inhibition.",Homo sapiens,Specific inhibition of DPY30 activity by peptides suppresses blood cancer cell growth

In this study, we analyze germline DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 38 families with strong CRC aggregation without alterations in known hereditary genes to detect rare candidate CNVs to CRC predisposition using ExomeDepth and CoNIFER tools. Variants shared between family members were compared to Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) catalogue and our Spanish database. CNVs finally selected were validated and segregation analysis were performed using Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH). Gene expression arrays and qRT-PCR were conducted in both germline and tumor cDNA to check possible effects at transcription level. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were also carried out. Whith this, 21 candidate CNV corresponding to 16 duplications and 5 deletions were detected by calling tools. After multiple filtering steps, only the duplication in chromosome 1 in family 7 stood out as interesting. Validation by CGH confirmed the duplication and correct family segregation. TTF2, TRIM45, VTCN1 and miR942 are embedded in chromosome 1 duplication. Expression studies pointed to TTF2 and miR942 overexpression in carriers, and tumor IHC showed TTF2 protein overexpression and underexpression of the TMEM158 protein.

Structure-based design yielded the potent, highly selective and orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor VTP-50469. Human cell lines carrying MLL-rearrangements were highly sensitive and selectively responsive to treatment with VTP-50469. VTP-50469 displaced Menin from high molecular weight protein complexes and inhibited chromatin occupancy of MLL1 at select target genes. Loss of MLL1 binding led to specific changes in gene expression, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Mice engrafted with leukemia cells isolated from patients with either MLL-r AML or MLL-r ALL showed dramatic reductions of leukemia burden and prolonged survival when treated with VTP-50469. Remarkably, multiple mice engrafted with MLL-r ALL remained disease free greater than 1 year following cessation of treatment.

In this investigation, we analyzed the DNA methylation of PU.1 cis-regulatory elements in PEL and the effect of restoring PU.1 on PEL cells. The expression of PU.1 mRNA was down-regulated in PEL cells. The promoter and enhancer regions of the PU.1 gene were highly methylated.

It thrives in a nutrient-poor environment; however, the mechanisms by which PDAC cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to adapt and survive in metabolic stress are still poorly understood. Here, we show that microRNA-135 is significantly increased in PDAC patient samples compared to adjacent normal tissue and represses aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, we found that miR-135 accumulates specifically in response to glutamine deprivation and requires ROS-dependent activation of mutant p53, which directly promotes miR-135 expression. Functionally, we found miR-135 targets phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and inhibits aerobic glycolysis, thereby promoting the utilization of glucose to support the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Consistently, miR-135 deficient PDAC cells preferentially use glutamine carbon to replenish the TCA cycle, and miR-135 silencing sensitizes PDAC cells to glutamine deprivation and represses tumour growth in vivo. Consistent with these findings, patient pancreatic cancer tissue displays decreased PFK1 level compared to adjacent normal tissue. Together, these results identify a mechanism used by PDAC cells to survive the nutrient-poor tumour microenvironment, and also provide insight regarding the role of mutant p53 and miRNA in pancreatic cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stresses.",Homo sapiens,MiR-135 suppresses glycolysis and promotes adaptation to metabolic stress in pancreatic cancer cells by targeting phosphofructokinase-1

However, the nuclear envelope is a dynamic barrier and cGAS is present in the nucleus. Here, we identify determinants of nuclear cGAS localization and activation. We show that nuclear-localized cGAS synthesizes cGAMP and induces innate immune activation of dendritic cells, but cGAMP levels are 200-fold lower than following transfection with exogenous DNA. Using cGAS ChIP-seq and a GFP-cGAS knock-in mouse, we find nuclear cGAS enrichment on centromeric satellite DNA, confirmed by imaging, and to a lesser extent with LINE elements.

This variability results in a risk for sampling bias and potential tumor escape from future targeted therapy. Heterogeneous gene expression within GBM is well documented, but little is known regarding the epigenetic heterogeneity. We therefore aimed to profile the intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity in GBM. Methods: 3-4 biopsies per tumor from spatially separated regions were collected from 12 GBM patients. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis (~850,000 CpG sites) and compared inter- and intra-tumor variation. Results: All samples were classified as GBM IDH wt or IDH mutated by DNA methylation profiling, but the GBM subtype differed within five tumors. Some GBM samples exhibited higher DNA methylation differences within tumors than between, and many CpG sites (mean: 17,000) had different methylation levels within the tumors. Conclusions: We demonstrated that intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity is a feature of GBM. Although all biopsies were classified as GBM IDH wt/mutated by DNA methylation analysis, the assigned subtype differed in samples from the same patient. The observed DNA methylation heterogeneity within tumors is important to consider for methylation-based biomarkers and future improvements in stratification of GBM patients.",Homo sapiens,Intra-Tumor DNA Methylation Heterogeneity in Glioblastoma; Implications for DNA Methylation-based Classification

Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). PGE-2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A (Nur77), with Prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-Retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of Prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib abrogates Prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation.

Although extensive studies have focused on the origin of the heterogeneity, biological interactions between heterogeneous malignant cells within a tumor are largely unexplored. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Here, we found that the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) is intratumorally heterogeneous in GBM. In a xenograft mouse model, differential YAP expression in glioma cells promotes tumorigenesis and leads to clonal dominance by cells expressing more YAP. Such clonal dominance also occurs in vitro when cells reach confluence in the two-dimensional culture condition or grow into tumor spheroids. During this process, growth of the dominant cell population is enhanced. In tumor spheroid, such enhanced growth is accompanied by increased apoptosis in cells expressing less YAP. The cellular interaction during clonal dominance appears to be reminiscent of cell competition. RNA-seq analysis suggested that the interaction induces expression of tumorigenic genes, which may contribute to the enhanced tumor growth.

To improve the clinical efficacy, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying tumor responses to radiation. Here, we investigated long-term cellular responses of human GBM cells to ionizing radiation. Comparing to the initial response within 12 hours, gene expression modulation at 7 days after radiation is markedly different. While genes related to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage responses are mostly modulated at the initial stage; immune-related genes are specifically affected as the long-term effect. This later response is associated with increased cellular senescence and inhibition of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Mechanistically, TAZ inhibition does not depend on the canonical Hippo pathway, but relies on enhanced degradation mediated by the β-catenin destruction complex in the Wnt pathway. We further showed that depletion of TAZ by RNAi promotes radiation-induced senescence and growth arrest. Pharmacological activation of the β-catenin destruction complex is able to promote radiation-induced TAZ inhibition and growth arrest in these tumor cells. The correlation between senescence and reduced expression of YAP as well as β-catenin also occurs in human gliomas treated by radiation. Collectively, these findings suggested that inhibition of TAZ is involved in radiation-induced senescence and might benefit GBM radiotherapy.",Homo sapiens,Inhibition of TAZ contributes radiation-induced senescence and growth arrest in glioma cells

To realize this goal, a highly reliable method to isolate preserved human RNA from stool samples is needed. Here we develop a protocol to identify RNA biomarkers associated with CRC to assess the use of these biomarkers for noninvasive screening of disease. Methods: Stool samples were collected from 454 patients prior to a colonoscopy. A nucleic acid extraction protocol was developed to isolate human RNA from 330 stool samples and transcript abundances were estimated by microarray analysis. This 330-patient cohort was split into a training set of 265 individuals to develop a machine learning model and a testing set of 65 individuals to determine the model’s ability to detect colorectal neoplasms. Results: Analysis of the transcriptome from 265 individuals identified 200 transcript clusters as differentially expressed (p<0.03). These transcripts were used to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model to classify 65 individuals within the testing set. This SVM algorithm attained a 95% sensitivity for precancerous adenomas and a 65% sensitivity for CRC (stage I-IV).

Of note, miRNA profiling of CD44v6+ SDCSCs identified a unique panel of miRNAs indicative of high self-renewal capacity. In particular, miR-1246 was overexpressed in CD44v6+ cells, and associated with poor OS (HR:2.44, CI:1.15–5.18, p<0.05) and DFS (HR:2.37, CI:1.03–5.44, p<0.05) in CRC patients. We demonstrate that CD44v6+ CSCs induced chemoresistance and enhance tumorigenicity in CRC cells, which is in part orchestrated by dysregulated profiles of a distinct panel of miRNAs. These findings provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of specific miRNAs, as well as serving as promising prognostic biomarkers in patients with colorectal neoplasia.",Homo sapiens,Cancer stem cells associated miRNAs serve as prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer

The widespread methylation changes involving almost the entire mucosa were identified as a major mechanism driving the development of the initial field effect. They also involved a small number of genomic amplifications and losses confirming the clonal nature of the initiating mucosal change. The mutations of the genes which included the activating mutation of Kras and an inactivating mutation of chromatin remodeling gene ACIN1 occured with the advent of carcinoma in situ and did not change with progression to frank carcinoma. The development of carcinoma was associated with copy number gain as a dominant change. A pattern of mutations and copy number changes in carcinoma in situ and several foci of carcinoma were almost identical confirming their clonal origin. The integrated analysis disclosed a complex and accummulating pattern of alterations of multiple oncogenic pathways already evident in mucosal field change.

Methods: To this end, we mapped lamin A and lamin B lamina-associated domains (LADs) by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) of lamin A/C (antibody sc7292x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and lamin B1 (antibody ab16048, Abcam), respectively. HepG2 cells were either cultured under proliferative conditions (controls) or exposed for 3 days to 10 uM cyclosporin A. We also assesed the transcriptome by RNA-seq under each condition in duplicate cultures. Results: CsA elicits accumulation of pre-lamin A in HepG2 cells, raising the hypothesis of a global rearrangement of lamin-chromatin interactions. We show here the existence of overlapping and distinct lamin A and B lamina-associated domains (which we refer to as A- and B-LADs, respectively). Whereas B-LADs largely remain constitutive, CsA elicits the formation of facultative A-LADs. Re-localization of A-LADs occur mainly on preexisting B-LADs. However, LAD rearrangement does not correlate with systematic changes in gene expression within LADs. We find a reorganization of A- and B-LADs after CsA treatment, entailing distinct contributions of A- and B- type lamins. to genome organization. Indeed, classification of lamin A LADs and lamin B LADs into properties of ‘A-only’, ‘B-only’ and ‘A-B’ LADs show an overall loss of A-only LADs after CsA treatment. A- only and B-only LADs are highly dynamic with A-B LADs being more stable.The rearrangement of lamin association after CsA treatment correlates with repositioning of loci in the nuclear space with, notably, a loss of lamin B associated with a re-localization of loci towards the nuclear center and conversely, a gain of lamin B linked to a repositioning of loci towards the nuclear periphery. Predictions on radial repositioning of LADs, and of loci within, from 3D structural models of the genome were supported by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Conclusions: We show that, while they amply co-localize on well-conserved LADs, lamins A and B also interact with distinct genomic regions that can interchange (switch) between lamin A and B upon CsA treatment. We unveil distinct lamin A and B interactions with chromatin, suggesting complementary contributions to genome conformation.

The multitude of prognostic tools in FL raises the question whether they identify common biology. Methods: In this study, we applied a modified risk score (MRS) to an independent gene-expression dataset of FL patients treated with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. Results: Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we showed that the MRS identifies patient groups with diverging outcomes in our dataset. In addition, using gene set enrichment and network identification, we discovered associations between the MRS, the m7-FLIPI, EZH2 mutation status and FOXP1 expression.

We performed a ChIP-seq analysis of the genome-wide occupancy of C/EBPalpha and identifeid a -1 kb C/EBPalpha-binding site in the LYL1 locus that mediate this repression.

MiRNA expression levels were investigated in three independent cohorts. Overall, 165 ascites samples (73 LC-ascites and 92 GC-ascites) were obtained from the National Biobank of Korea. Initially, microarrays were used to screen the expression levels of 2,006 miRNAs in the discovery cohort (n = 22).

In addition, the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a commonly used tumor marker, were determined in the ascites samples. Expression levels of miR-574-3p, miR-181b-5p, miR-4481, and miR-181d were significantly lower in the GC-ascites samples than in the LC-ascites samples, and miR-181b-5p showed the best diagnostic performance for GC-ascites (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.798 and 0.846 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively).

The two principal forms of PA are bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH) and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) whose differentiation is clinically pivotal, due to their different treatments. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is considered to be the gold standard for the differentiation of the two clinical entities, but it is invasive, requires great expertise and is unavailable in many centers. There would be a major clinical need for a reliable and easily accessible diagnostic biomarker. Circulating microRNA were shown to be useful as minimally invasive diagnostic markers in many diseases, but their potential applicability in PA has not yet been investigated. Aims: To determine and compare the circulating microRNA expression profiles of AVS-confirmed APA and BAH plasma samples, and to evaluate their applicability as minimally invasive markers. Methods: 81 AVS-confirmed plasma samples were included. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 30 EDTA-anticoagulated plasma samples. Significantly differently expressed miRNAs were validated by real-time RT-qPCR on all samples. Results: We have found relative overexpression of miR-30e-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-7-5p in BAH compared to APA by NGS. Validation of 81 samples confirmed significant overexpression (p=0.03) of miR-7-5p. Regarding the microRNA expressional variations, APA is more heterogenous at the miRNA level compared to BAH. Conclusion: miR-7-5p was significantly overexpressed in BAH samples compared to APA samples, but its sensitivity and specificity values are not good enough for introduction to the clinical practice yet.",Homo sapiens,Circulating miRNA expression profiling in primary aldosteronism

Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 caused wide-spread loss of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase. This loss of 5’ pausing was associated with accumulation of polymerases in the body of a large number of genes. However, there were modest effects on genes regulated by “super-enhancers”.

Consistent with this hypothesis, polyA site-sequencing (PolyA-seq) did not detect differences in polyA sites after THZ1 treatment.

In this study we explore the role of TBX3 in breast cancer progression pathways, focusing specifically on its involvement in the induction of EMT and the transition from DCIS to invasive mammary carcinoma. Methods: Total mRNA was isolated from 21NT transfected cell lines.

Results: An EMT-related transcriptional profile was observed with overexpression of TBX3iso1 and TBX3iso2.

To fully elucidate the transcriptome of prostate tumours, we performed ultra-deep total RNA-Seq on 144 localized prostate tumours with long-term clinical follow up. Analysis of linear RNAs identified a transcriptomic subtype associated with the aggressive intraductal carcinoma subhistology, and a fusion gene profile that differentiates localized from metastatic prostate cancers. Analysis of back-splicing events identified widespread RNA circularization, with the average tumour expressing 7,140 distinct circular RNAs. The degree of aberrant circRNA production is correlated to disease progression in multiple clinical cohorts. Loss of function screens identified 11.3% of the screened circRNAs as essential to prostate cancer proliferation, and for 93.6% of these, their parental linear genes are not required for proliferation.

As the IC50 value of EGCG is approximately 304 μM, our studies support the resistance of A549 lung cancer cell by EGCG. In addition, it was interesting to observe its G0/G1 cell cycle arrest activity at 40μM EGCG treatment. So, in the present study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to study the miRNA expression between the cancer control and EGCG-treated samples. A549 cells were treated with 40 μM and 100 μM EGCG. NGS was employed to study the differential expression of novel and known miRNAs. The data generated was analysed with computational approach to study and correlate the expression profiles of both known and novel miRNAs. Differential expression of known miRNAs was observed between control and EGCG-treated samples. Some putative novel miRNA sequences were also observed in the current study. The differential expression levels of putative novel miRNA sequences were estimated by counting the number of reads in the given dataset. Together the analysis of these miRNA profiles revealed log2-fold modulation in the expression levels. We detected 344, 337, and 346 number of known mature miRNAs in control, 40 μM EGCG treated, and 100 μM EGCG treated samples, respectively. We also reported 119, 126, and 125 number of putative novel mature miRNA sequences in control, 40 μM EGCG treated, and 100 μM EGCG treated samples, respectively.

How these ERα mutations elicit an aggressive tumor phenotype was largely unknown. Recently, we reported cell lines in which the wild-type ESR1 gene is replaced by the two most common ERα mutations, ERαY537S and ERαD538G. Here we use transcriptome analysis to demonstrate that ERαY537S cells exhibit a unique expression profile and phenotype, and identify an important role for Myc in the increased growth rate, ligand independent cell proliferation, and partial resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant of cells expressing the ERαY537S and ERαD538G mutations. Notably, the T47DERαY537S (TYS) cells exhibit a markedly different phenotype and transcriptome than the parental T47D cells and T47DERαD538G (TDG) cells. Consistent with their estrogen-independent proliferation, RNAseq shows the TYS and TDG cells exhibit estrogen independent gene expression patterns. Gene set enrichment analysis showed Myc target pathways are highly induced in both mutant cell lines. Unlike the parental T47D cells, in TYS and TDG cells Myc mRNA and protein exhibit constitutive, fulevestrant-resistant expression. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that ERαY537S and ERαD538G exhibit constitutive, fulvestrant-resistant, recruitment to the Myc enhancer region. Myc knockdown showed that Myc protein is required for ligand independent proliferation of TYS and TDG cells. Constitutive MYC expression in T47D cells, to levels similar to those in TYS and TDG cells, partially recapitulated the aggressive phenotypes of the TYS and TDG cells. Our study demonstrates a previously undescribed role for constitutive and antiestrogen resistant Myc expression in the aggressive phenotype exhibited by breast cancer cells expressing ERα mutations and provides powerful tools for identifying pathways that contribute to the ERα mutant phenotype.",Homo sapiens,Transcriptome Analysis Reveals a Role for Myc in Constitutive and Antiestrogen-resistant Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells Expressing ERαY537S and ERαD538G Mutations

Transcription from H1-bound chromatin is elicited by H1 chaperone NAP1, which is recruited in a gene-specific manner through direct interactions with activator-bound p300 that facilitate core histone acetylation (by p300) and concomitant eviction of H1 and H2A/H2B. An analysis in B cells confirms the strong dependency on NAP1-mediated H1 eviction for induction of the silent CD40 gene and further demonstrates that H1 eviction, seeded by activator-p300-NAP1 interactions, is propagated over a CTCF-demarcated region through a distinct mechanism that also involves NAP1.

We have integrated 23 transcription datasets, spanning 1350 MB and 291 normal brain samples. To remove batch effects, we combined the Removal of Unwanted Variation (RUV) method with a novel pipeline for determining empirical negative control genes and a panel of metrics to evaluate normalization performance. The documented approach enabled the removal of a majority of batch effects, producing a large-scale, integrative dataset of MB and cerebellar expression data. The proposed strategy will be broadly applicable for accurate integration of data and incorporation of normal reference samples for studies of various diseases.

Additional master genes involved in promoting melanoma growth and invasive state have been identified within the family of epigenetic regulators.

We screened several MRT cell lines each with large-scale RNAi, CRISPR-Cas9, and small-molecule libraries to identify potential drug targets specific for these cancers. We discovered MDM2 and MDM4, the canonical negative regulators of p53, as significant vulnerabilities. Using two compounds currently in clinical development, idasanutlin and ATSP-7041, we show that MRT cells are more sensitive than other p53 wild-type cancer cell lines to MDM2 and dual MDM2/4 inhibition in vitro. These compounds cause significant upregulation of the p53 pathway in MRT cells, and sensitivity is ablated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of TP53. We show that loss of SMARCB1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF (BAF) complex mutated in nearly all MRT, sensitizes cells to MDM2 and MDM2/4 inhibition by enhancing p53-mediated apoptosis. Both MDM2 and MDM2/4 inhibition slowed MRT xenograft growth in vivo, with a five-day idasanutlin pulse causing marked regression of all xenografts including durable complete responses in 50% of mice.

METHODS: CTCs were isolated from peripheral blood (PB) via immunomagnetic enrichment followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (IE-FACS). CTCs, PB and fresh tumors were profiled with RNA Seq. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors were subjected to RNA Seq and NanoString PAM50 assays with Risk of Recurrence (ROR) scores. RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 29/33 (88%) of patients. We selected 21 cases to attempt RNA Seq (median number of CTCs=9). 16 CTC samples yielded results that passed quality control metrics. These samples had a median of 4,311,255 uniquely mapped reads, less than PB or tumors. Intrinsic subtype predicted by comparing estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 versus PAM50 for FFPE tumors was 85% concordant. However, CTC RNA Seq subtype assessed by the PAM50 classification genes was highly discordant both with the subtype predicted by ER/PR/HER2 as well as by tumor PAM50. Two patients died of metastatic disease - both had high ROR scores and high CTC counts. We identified significant genes, canonical pathways, upstream regulators and molecular interaction networks comparing CTCs by various clinical factors.

Aberrations in TP53 and its downstream effectors play a key role in promoting bladder cancer progression, however, TP53 mutation status is neither an independent indicator of treatment response nor survival in MIBC. The hypothesis of this study was that evaluating overall TP53 function would be informative in predicting responsiveness to therapy. Towards this goal, we developed a custom-designed “TP53 functional miRGE assay”, which assesses TP53 function by simultaneously measuring the expression of 105 TP53-responsive mRNAs and miRNAs using NanoString nCounter technology. Expression profiling was performed on a panel of 34 therapy-naïve MIBC specimens with known outcomes of either being responsive or resistant. Clustering analysis identified a 7-gene subset of TP53 network genes (BAK1, BAX, BBC3, CDKN1A, MDM2, PMAIP1, TP53), which identified patients who did not respond to chemotherapy with 92.3% accuracy. Furthermore, higher TP53 function was associated more with resistant MIBCs in that these exhibited higher relative expression of TP53 target genes.

Prostate-specific antigene (PSA) measurement leads to high percentages of both false positives and false negatives. In the era of liquid biopsies, we propose to combine PSA dosage with the evaluation of circulating microRNAs (miRs), to discriminate between men harbouring or not PCa. Methods: miR profiling of plasma samples from 60 men with PCa, 51 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 27 healthy donors (HD) was performed using microarrays. Univariate analysis (linear models with an empirical Bayes approach) and multivariate penalized logistic regression models were applied to highlight miRs and clinical variables associated with the presence of malignant disease, and were combined in a classification score. Finally, the developed score was tested on an independent dataset of 242 plasma samples (68 PCa, 8 premalignant lesions, 93 BPH, 73 HD), where miR expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Results: Out of 2006 miRs analyzed, a linear combination of miR-103a-3p and let-7a-5p with PSA defined our score. A classification rule based on this score allowed reclassification of samples with accuracy (0.61), sensitivity (0.87), specificity (0.35) and AUC (0.68) higher than those obtained by PSA alone. On the validation set, the same classification rule still performed better than PSA alone in terms of specificity (0.57 versus 0.55) and AUC (0.76 versus 0.74), allowing correct reclassification of all but one tumors not detected by PSA and 33% of BPH with PSA in the 4-16 ng/ml range. Conclusion: The combination of two circulating miRs with PSA could be an interesting biomarker to detect the presence of PCa (even when PSA levels are below the standard cut-off of 4 ng/ml) and the absence of PCa in an important fraction of men with high PSA, who may avoid unnecessary biopsies.",Homo sapiens,Circulating microRNAs combined with PSA for an accurate and non-invasive prostate cancer detection

MicroDNA which carry miRNA genes form transcripts which are processed into mature miRNA molecules, through the endogenous RNA-interference pathway, which repress a luciferase reporter gene as well as endogenous mRNA targets of the miRNA.

The PIC component eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), encoded on human chromosomes X and Y by EIF1AX and EIF1AY, respectively, is essential for recruitment of the ternary complex and for assembling the 43S PIC, which after recruitment onto capped mRNAs scans their 5’UTR and localizes the AUG to initiate translation. Recurrent EIF1AX mutations are found in several cancers, including ~1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other drivers (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions).

However, some members of the MMP family have recently been identified as proteases with antitumor properties. Thus, it has been described that collagenase-2 (MMP-8) has a protective role in tumor and metastasis progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. We show herein that Mmp8 expression causes a decrease in miR-21 levels that in turn leads to a reduction in tumor growth and lung metastasis formation by MDA-MB-231 (4175) breast cancer cells. By using both in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that the mechanism responsible for these MMP-8 beneficial effects involves cleavage of decorin by MMP-8 and a subsequent reduction of transforming growth factor ?

Global inhibition of TGF-β1 carries known risks, including autoimmune disease. Here we elucidate the signaling pathway subserving modulation of glucocorticoid activity by TGF-β1. The proteomic response of airway epithelial cells to TGF-β1 revealed 24 candidate proteins of which 3 were prioritized by exclusion of changes induced by: TGF-β2, which lacks the modulatory activity of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3; and those of TGF-β1 that were prevented by small molecule inhibitors of non-canonical TGF-β1 signaling, that did not prevent glucocorticoid modulation. Pharmacological and genetic approaches establish that TGF-β1-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity is mediated by a novel signaling cascade involving LIM domain kinase 2 mediated phosphorylation of phospho-cofilin1 that activates phospholipase D to generate the effector(s) (lyso)phophatidic acid.

Methods: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from 50-ml urine samples from 10 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 10 matched healthy donors. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and further validated in kidney cancer cell lines, tissues and urinary exosomes.

Results: The levels of lncRNAs NR_040448 and NR_033390 in urinary exosomes can likely indicate the presence of renal cell carcinoma.

In M0 patients, the cluster status clearly separated in survival (pCSS5yr 81 % vs 17 %; p < 0.001). We identified a methylation profile of 398 CpGs that was associated with progress of disease, which included differently methylated CpG sites in the SMAD6, SOCS3 and MX2 genes.

To derive disease-specific epigenetic changes we have compared CLL subgroups to their corresponding cell of origin. Our data showed that naïve B-cells, compared to non-class switched and class switched memory B-cells, had higher levels of 5-hmC and 5-mC. By comparing with ChIP sequencing data of H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 modifications of CLL samples with 5hmC and 5mC levels, we observed an increase of 5-hmC at overall gene body regions, CpG island shores and regulatory elements. Comparing 5-hmC distribution with RNA sequencing we showed that genes with higher transcriptional activity had higher 5-hmC and vice versa.

Thus far, HCC prognosis has remained extremely poor given the lack of effective treatments. Numerous studies have described the roles played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer progression and the potential of these small noncoding RNAs for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. The current consensus supports the idea that direct repression of a wide range of oncogenes by a single key miRNA may critically affect the malignant properties of cancer cells in a synergistic manner. In this study, we aimed to investigate the oncogenes controlled by miR-493-5p, a major tumor suppressor miRNA that inactivates miR-483-3p oncomir in hepatic cancer cells. Using global gene expression analysis, we highlighted a set of candidate genes potentially regulated by miR-493-5p. In particular, the canonical MYCN proto-oncogene (MYCN) appeared to be an attractive target of miR-493-5p given its significant inhibition via 3’-UTR targeting in miR-493-5p-rescued HCC cells. We showed that MYCN was overexpressed in liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples from HCC patients. Notably, MYCN expression levels were inversely correlated with miR-493-5p in tumor tissues. We confirmed that MYCN knockdown mimicked the anti-cancer effect of miR-493-5p by inhibiting HCC cell growth and invasion, whereas MYCN rescue hindered miR-493-5p activity. In summary, miR-493-5p is a pivotal miRNA that modulates various oncogenes after its re-expression in liver cancer cells, suggesting that tumor suppressor miRNAs with a large spectrum of action may provide valuable tools for miRNA replacement therapies.",Homo sapiens,Characterization of microRNA-493-5p targets in liver cell lines (2nd set of data)

It was also of interest to determine whether compounds show a selective inhibitory effect on the NF-kB consenus sequence and hence NF-kB signalling. Methods: NF-kB is often overexpressed and over-active in multiple myeloma. Therefore, JJN3 myeloma cells were selected for this investigation. These cells were treated with 2 PBD monomers - DC-1-170 and DC-1-192 - at a concentration of 30nM, in triplicate alongside untreated controls. They were lysed in Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher) and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-prep kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was then taken forward for RNA-seq. Downstream analysis was performed using GenView2 software (in-house analysis tool developed by Peter Giles) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). Results: RNA-seq analysis revealed an overall inhibitory effect on gene transcription as a result of treatment with both PBD monomers, with a small proportion of genes experiencing increased transcription. Approximately 80% of genes that were altered were common to both PBD compounds tested. Both PBD compounds also showed significant inhibition of NF-kB signalling. Conclusions: RNA-sequencing confirmed gene set enrichment for NF-κB pathway genes although as expected, other canonical pathways were also affected.

This effect occurs, at least in part, via non-canonical recruitment of pre-EJC components at promoters. Failure to recruit the pre-EJC at promoters results in increased binding of the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) and in enhanced Pol II release. Notably, restoring pausing is sufficient to rescue exon skipping and the photoreceptor differentiation defect associated with depletion of pre-EJC components in vivo.

Moreover, to better analyze the specific contribution of metabolic gene alterations potentially associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression, we evaluated the transcription profile of primary renal tumor cells. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed a signature of an increased glucose uptake and utilization in ccRCC. In addition, metabolites related to pentose phosphate pathway were also altered in the tumor samples in association with changes in Krebs cycle intermediates and related metabolites.

Finally we showed that silencing of NDUFA4L2 affects cell viability, increases mitochondrial mass, and induces ROS generation in hypoxia. These findings delineate a ccRCC metabolic signature characterized by an anaerobic switch that favors rerouting of the sugar metabolism toward the PPP, and impairs the mitochondrial activity though the overexpression of NDUFA4L2.

While considerable effort has focused in the regulators involved in the transition process, we have focused on consequences of EMT to prosurvival signaling. Changes in distinct metastable and ‘epigentically-fixed’ EMT states were measured by correlation of protein, phosphoprotein, phosphopeptide and RNA transcript abundance. The assembly of 1167 modulated components into functional systems or machines simplified biological understanding and increased prediction confidence highlighting four functional groups: cell adhesion and migration, metabolism, transcription nodes and proliferation/survival networks. A coordinate metabolic reduction in a cluster of 17 free-radical stress pathway components was observed and correlated with reduced glycolytic and increased oxidative phosphorylation enzyme capacity, consistent with reduced cell cycling and reduced need for macromolecular biosynthesis in the mesenchymal state. An attenuation of EGFR autophosphorylation and a switch from autocrine to paracrine-competent EGFR signaling was implicated in the enablement of tumor cell chemotaxis. A similar attenuation of IGF1R, MET and RON signaling with EMT was observed. In contrast, EMT increased prosurvival autocrine IL11/IL6-JAK2-STAT signaling, autocrine fibronectin-integrin activation, autocrine Axl/Tyro3/PDGFR/FGFR RTK signaling and autocrine TGF-R signaling. A relatively uniform loss of polarity and cell-cell junction linkages to actin cytoskeleton and intermediate filaments was measured at a systems level. A more heterogeneous gain of ECM remodeling and associated with invasion and migration was observed.

The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. These data suggest an RNA-poise model, where the spatial proximity of one gene’s transcripts and the other gene’s genomic sequence poises for the creation of fusion transcripts.

Hepatocyte-Kupffer cell co-cultures can model inflammation-mediated hepatotoxicity; however, Kupffer cell (KC) source remains an important bottleneck for the development of such models. Primary human Kupffer cells (PHKCs) are costly, limited in availability and exhibit donor variability. An alternative cell source for KCs has not been reported. Important paradigm shift from the classical dogma of adult blood-circulating monocyte-derived macrophages to intrahepatic precursor/fetal monocyte-derived macrophages has shed new light into the origin of KCs in vivo. Based on these recent findings, we report here, a novel method to generate human KCs in vitro from stem cells (hPSC-KCs) via fetal monocytes. hPSC-KCs expressed macrophage markers, CD11, CD14, CD68, CD163 and CD32 at gene and protein level and exhibited functional properties such as phagocytosis and Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-4alpha production upon activation. Importantly, molecular signature, liver-macrophage specific CLEC-4F expression and cytokines production levels of hPSC-KCs were similar to PHKCs but different from non-liver macrophages. We used an inflammatory liver co-culture model to demonstrate that activated hPSC-KCs, but not non-liver macrophages, were able to recapitulate effects of PHKCs when stimulated with paradigm hepatotoxicants. hPSC-KCs developed in this study offer a renewable human cell source for liver-specific macrophages which can be used to develop in vitro systems for modelling the inflammatory state of the liver.

The resulting classifier correctly classified all samples from a validation cohort consisting of 680 primary pulmonary, colorectal and upper gastrointestinal ADCs from TCGA and the GEO database, demonstrating the ability of the algorithm to reliably distinguish these three entities. We then analyzed DNA methylation data of 15 PEADs as well as four pulmonary metastases and four primary colorectal ADCs with the algorithm. All 15 PEADs were reliably classified as primary pulmonary tumors and all four metastases as well as all four primary colorectal ADC samples were identified as primary colorectal ADCs. In a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis, the PEAD samples did not form a separate methylation subclass but rather diffusely intermixed with other pulmonary ADCs. Additional characterization of the PEAD series using fluorescence in-situ hybridization, next generation sequencing and copy number analysis revealed KRAS mutations in nine of 15 samples (60%) and a high number of structural chromosomal changes. Except for an unusually high rate of chromosome 20 gain (66.7%) the molecular data was mostly reminiscent of standard pulmonary ADCs.

Here, we show that this vulnerability is conserved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where SMARCA4 loss also results in reduced cyclin D1 expression and selective sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In addition, SMARCA2, another SWI/SNF subunit lost in a subset of NSCLCs, also regulates cyclin D1 and drug response when SMARCA4 is absent. Mechanistically, SMARCA2/4 loss reduces cyclin D1 expression by a combination of restricting CCND1 chromatin accessibility and suppressing c-jun, a transcription activator of CCND1. Furthermore, SMARCA4 loss is synthetic lethal with CDK4/6 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors could be effective to treat this significant subgroup of NSCLCs.",Homo sapiens,SMARCA4 loss is synthetic lethal with CDK4/6 via restriction CCND1 chromatin accessibility in lung cancer

Understanding the underlying mechanisms in chemo-resistance is critical to further improve the efficacy of HCC treatment. In this study, we found that increased expression of Id-1 and CCN2 were closely related to oxaliplatin resistance in HCC. Upregulation of CCN2 and Id-1 was independently associated with shorter survival and increased recurrence in HCC patients, and significantly enhanced oxaliplatin resistance and promoted lung metastasis in vivo, whereas knock-down of their expression significantly reversed the chemo-resistance and inhibited HCC cell stemness. cDNA microarrays and PCR revealed that Id-1 and MAPK pathway were the downstream signaling of CCN2, and Id-1 could upregulate CCN2 in a positive feedback manner. Moreover, CCN2 significantly enhanced oxaliplatin resistance by activating the MAPK signaling pathway and upregulating Id-1 expression. Meanwhile, MAPK/Id-1 signaling was demonstrated as one of the most important autocrine signaling pathways regulated by CCN2 in oxaliplatin-resistant models, and combination with sorafenib could improve the efficacy of oxaliplatin in HCC.

The present study was aimed at identifying the entire set of genes that are differentially activated by insulin glargine or detemir, in comparison to regular insulin and IGF1, in Type 1 and Type 2 endometrial cancer cell lines (ECC-1 and USPC-1, respectively). Global gene expression analyses demonstrated a ligand-dependent up-regulated expression of filamin-A (FLNA), a gene that encodes an actin filament cross-linking protein, in both endometrial cancer cell types. Silencing experiments linked to migration assays confirmed the role of FLNA in cell growth and motility. Our data suggest that the activation of distinct sets of genes by glargine may lead to stimulation of specific pathways or, alternatively, may provide additive effects, different from those classically induced by insulin. Given that metastasis is one of the major factors contributing to the aggressiveness of tumors, the identification of FLNA as a downstream target for insulin-like hormones may be of translational relevance in cancer research.

The untranslocated MLL1 is a substrate for proteolytic cleavage by the endopeptidase, taspase1, however, the biological significance of MLL1 cleavage by this endopeptidase remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that taspase1-dependent cleavage of MLL1 results in the destabilization of full-length MLL. Upon loss of taspase1, MLL1 association with chromatin is markedly increased due to the stabilization of its unprocessed version and this stabilization of the uncleaved MLL1 can result in the displacement of MLL-chimeras from chromatin in leukemic cells. Casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates MLL1 proximal to the taspase1 cleavage site, facilitating its cleavage, and pharmacological inhibition of CKII blocks taspase1-dependent MLL1 processing, increases MLL1 stability, and results in the displacement of the MLL-chimeras from chromatin. Furthermore, inhibition of CKII in MLL-AF9 mouse model of leukemia delayed leukemic progression in vivo.

Such dependency results from FBXO32-driven transcriptional reprogramming of critical EMT genes and involved changes in their chromatin state. Furthermore, we found that CTBP1, an established regulator of EMT, requires FBXO32 ubiquitination at Lysine 63 for its nuclear retention and gene regulatory function.

However, understanding of the complexity of DNA is far from complete, resulting in the failure of therapies using genotoxic reagents. Here, we found that LARP7, an RNA-binding protein known to stabilize 7SK RNA, was degraded after DNA injury caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. The LARP7 degradation was catalyzed by an E3 ligase complex of BRCA1 and BARD1 that was triggered by ATM-mediated phosphorylation. LARP7 depletion caused transcriptional repression of the cell cycle regulators CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDK1; this repression arrested cells before the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and reduced BRCA2 phosphorylation, therefore enhancing Rad51 recruitment and ultimately ensuring the homologous repair of damaged DNA. Importantly, the increased DNA damage repair capacity induced by LARP7 depletion caused resistance to ionizing radiation and CDDP treatment in both wild-type and BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells and in mouse xenografts. Such resistance also contributed to reduced relapse-free survival rates in breast cancer patients with low levels of LARP7 after chemotherapy. Taken together, the results of this study show that LARP7 coordinates cell cycle progression and faithful DNA repair.

Thus, premature polyadenylation-mediated reduction in stathmin-2 is a hallmark of ALS/FTD that functionally links reduced nuclear TDP-43 function to enhanced neuronal vulnerability.",Homo sapiens,Premature polyadenylation-mediated loss of stathmin-2 is a hallmark of TDP-43-dependent neurodegeneration

In hepatocellular carcinoma activating mutations in CTNNB1 (20-25%) or loss of function mutations in AXIN1 (10%), AXIN2 (2%) and APC (1-2%) are observed. All these mutations lead to aberrant stabilization of β-catenin, which constitutively activates downstream Wnt/β-catenin target genes and triggers a genetic program resulting in tumor formation. However, in relation to AXIN1 mutations some reports have challenged whether these indeed result in tumor growth by enhancing β-catenin signaling (e.g. PMID: 16964294, 29525529). Several alternative pathways have also been linked to AXIN1 (ENSG00000103126), such as TGFβ, SAPK/JNK, p53, YAP/TAZ and c-myc. To identify which one of these or other unknown signaling routes are linked to AXIN1, using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we have successfully repaired the homozygous p.R712* AXIN1 mutation present in the SNU449 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Next, using RNA sequencing the RNA expression patterns of 3 independent repaired clones were compared with 3 clones retaining the AXIN1 mutation. Surprisingly, only 5 genes were significantly altered in the repaired clones, among which AXIN2, a well-established β-catenin target gene.

Methods: Primary cells were isolated from fresh uterine myometrium or leiomyoma tissue. Cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 5 µM 5’-aza for 96h with medium refreshed every 24h. Genomic DNA was extracted from LM and MM cells using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504) and fragmented to 300-500bp using Covaris M220. Methylated DNA fragments were captured using the MethylCap Kit (Diagenode, C02020010). Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8502) and KAPA Single-Indexed Adapter Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8710). Libraries were sequenced under 75bp paired-end sequencing format. Sequences were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using Bowtie2. Histone style peak calling, differential binding analysis (getDifferentialPeaks) and motif analysis were performed using Homer under default settings. Differentily methylated regions (DMRs) were detected with a fold enrichment over background tag count ≥4 and poisson enrichment p-value over background tag count <0.0001. Differential DNA methylation between MM and LM (with or without treatment) at select regions were validated through qPCR. Results: More than 100,000 methyalted regions were detected in each sample. We discovered 21,086 DMRs between MM and LM cells under basal (vehicle treated) condition. In cells treated with 5-aza, we detected 8811 DMRs between MM and LM. We compared the genomic context of DMRs identified by MethylCap-Seq with the probe distribution of the HM450 array and detected large differences between these two methods. For example, 44.23% of DMR were located in intergenic regions by MethylCap-Seq, which was drastically higher than the percentage of HM450 array probes located in intergenic regions Downstream network enrichment analysis and motif analysis indicated that DMR-associated genes and regions are crucial for the tumor progression and hormone responsiveness of LM. Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of differential DNA methyaltion profiles between MM and LM using MethylCap-seq. Our results showed a more comprehensive evaluation of DNA methyaltion landscapes of MM and LM compared with previous array based analysis.

However, only a subset of patients benefits from this therapy and biomarkers to guide clinical decisions are lacking. This study aimed to discover circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential stratifying and monitoring biomarkers in patients with PDAC treated with FOLFIRINOX and to investigate their functional roles. Methods: A microarray was used in plasma samples from a first cohort of 11 patients selected based on their long versus short progression-free survival (PFS) after FOLFIRINOX. Nine miRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR in an independent cohort (n=43). The best discriminative miRNA was evaluated in tumor tissue samples and associated with clinicopathological features by Cox regression analyses. In vitro studies explored its role on cell proliferation, key downstream targets, and interaction with 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. Results: MiR-181a-5p was validated as significantly down-regulated in non-progressive compared to progressive patients after FOLFIRINOX. In multivariate analysis, this down-regulation correlated with improved PFS and overall survival, especially combined with CA19.9 decline (log-rank p<0.001, HR=0.153, 95% C.I. 0.067–0.347 and log-rank p=0.033, HR=0.201, 95% C.I. 0.070–0.576, respectively). Overexpression of miR-181a-5p increased proliferation of PDAC cells and inversely correlated with expression of ATM. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-181a-5p coupled with oxaliplatin exposure increased DNA damage and decreased cell viability. Conclusion: Our findings endorse miR-181a-5p as a biomarker for monitoring response to FOLFIRINOX and prognostication.

Methods: Progressive and regressive CIS lesions were laser-captured and their genome, epigenome and transcriptome interrogated. We analysed 83 progressive lesions, 41 regressive and 33 normal epithelial control samples. DNA methylation and gene expression profiles were further validated using publicly available lung cancer data. Results: Somatic mutation burden was higher in progressive lesions than regressive CIS lesions, across base substitutions, rearrangements, insertions and deletions. Driver mutations were present in both progressive and regressive CIS lesions, but were more numerous in progressive cases. Progressive and regressive CIS lesions had distinct epigenomic and transcriptional profiles, with a strong chromosomal instability signature. Gene expression, methylation and copy number profiles can all predict accurately which CIS lesions will progress to lung cancer. Conclusion: Pre-invasive CIS lesions that will subsequently progress to invasive lung cancer can be distinguished from those that will regress using molecular profiling.

Here we investigated whether NB could be controlled via dual targeting of the transcription elongation machinery and cell cycle progression, using an orally bioavailable and selective CDK9/2 inhibitor CYC065. CYC065 blocks nascent transcription and leads to a drastic reduction in steady-state levels of short-lived transcripts. In MYCN-amplified NB, CYC065 rapidly and completely eliminated MYCN mRNA and protein, terminating expression of a MYCN-dependent gene expression programme. This result is phenocopied by multiple clinical-candidate CDK9 chemical inhibitors and genetic manipulation of CDK9. Mechanistically, CYC065 dissociates MYCN from physical proximity of P-TEFb in cells. P-TEFb co-occupies promoters and enhancers of de-differentiating pathway genes highly-occupied by MYCN, and CDK9 inhibition terminates expression of these and other highly transcribed genes. Intriguingly, targeted inhibition of CDK9 alone is insufficient to eradicate MYCN-dependent cells lines as CDK9 loss alone is compensated by upregulation of CDK2. CYC065 targeted MYCN-driven neuroblastoma in vivo, resulted in tumor regression or eradication and prolonged survival in multiple NB models, and was effective against a wide range of Myc-dependent cancer cells lines in vitro. The data establish that combined CDK9/CDK2 inhibition blocks transcriptional dependence induced by MYCN, highlighting a potential clinical strategy by which many Myc-driven cancers could be targeted.",Homo sapiens,Pharmacological blockade of MYCN in neuroblastoma using orally-bioavailable CDK inhibitors reveals an approach widely applicable to Myc-dependent cancers

We hypothesised that Neuropilin-1, a transmembrane co-receptor for ligands of the semaphorin and growth factor families, promotes the suppressive function of human Tregs. Utilising in vitro lentivirus-mediated transduction with shRNA to knock down neuropilin-1 in primary human Tregs, we demonstrated that neuropilin-1 knockdown Tregs were severely impaired in their capacity to suppress cell proliferation in vitro and in their ability to prolong allograft survival in a humanised mouse model of transplantation.

Unlike many neoplasms in colons, LST grows to extremely large size, usually greater than 10mm in diameter while rarely invades deeply. Also, there is a low tendency for LSTs to become cancerous. The epigenetic landscape of LST has not been defined. In this study, we used a genome-wide methylation profiling technology, i.e. the Illumina Human Methylation 450K array, to query the main epigenetic difference between LST and para-cancerous samples. Our results suggest that LST displays significant decrease in DNA methylation, especially in some intergenic regions (IGR). By integration of public data for adenomas and colorectal cancers, we defined the commonality and specific epigenetic signatures for these three types of neoplasms in colon, in particular LST and adenomas which represent precancerous conditions. These three diseases shared little specific DNA methylation abnormalities. However, our pathway-level analysis revealed that certain pathways were common targets of epimutation. More interestingly, different diseases seem to employ distinct epigenetic insult to disturb these pathways. Between LST and adenoma, we found eight pathways were commonly targeted but the epi-mutation patterns were opposite between the two diseases. Comparison between precancerous conditions and invasive states revealed the key pathways governing the progression to malignancy, including CAMs and PI3K-Akt pathways.",Homo sapiens,Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of primary colorectal laterally spreading tumors identifies disease-specific epi-mutations on common pathways

MMSET is capable of producing 3 major isoforms, the full length MMSET II, short isoforms REIIBP and MMSET I.

We also found MMSET I knockdown decreased GLO1 expression, and ectopic MMSET I increased GLO1 expression, suggesting that MMSET I is an upstream regulator of GLO1.

However, disruption of F-actin polymerization by WAS mutations can not account for many aspects of WAS pathogenesis.

Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from WAS patients (WAS-iPSC) bearing different mutations and corresponding isogenic iPSCs in which the pathogenic mutations had been corrected by targeted genome editing. Hematopoietic cells differentiated from WAS-iPSCs not only recapitulated known disease phenotypes, but also revealed novel defects of WASP deficient cells.
